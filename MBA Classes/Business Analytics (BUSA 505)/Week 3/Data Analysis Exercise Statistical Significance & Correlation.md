By answering these questions you will be able to get credit for this assignment and be ready to learn about the more complex concepts that we will cover in this course.

1. Explain what a p value is. When is it used and what insight does it provide?
	1. P-value tells how likely a result happened by chance. We use it to figure out if finding are statistically significant, they're not random.
3. What does p < 0.05 mean?
	1. There is less than 5% chance of this result, this prompts rejecting the null hypothesis and accepting the alternative.
5. What is confidence level? For example, if I have a 95% confidence level, what does that mean?
	1. 
7. Sometimes p values are attributed to giving a false positive. What does this mean and how might it be avoided?
	1. A false positive appears true but is false, this can be avoided with stricter p-value and multiple tests. 
9. What is a null hypothesis and how does it relate to p value?
	1. The null hypothesis is a statement that there is no significant difference between two variables. The p-value helps to inform the decision to reject the null hypothesis, and accept the alternative hypothesis. 
10. If your p value is high (above 0.05) what does this mean?
	1. There isn't enough reason to reject the null hypothesis, there is a not a big difference between the two groups being compared.
11. If your p value is low (below 0.05) what does this mean?
	1. There is enough reason to reject the null hypothesis, there is a big difference between the two groups being compared. 
13. Is a p value the same as an error rate? Explain your answer.
	1. No, p-value is related to the probability of making an error rate, the error rate is the proportion of times errors occur.
15. Below are the actual results of a study that was done with an organization to determine if there was a difference between how two different divisions viewed leaders. In other words, were there certain attributes one division looked for in their leaders that were significantly different than the other divisions? Understanding this was important to the organization to determine why one division was outperforming the other division. It was hypothesized that a difference exists between the two divisions in terms of the attributes they looked for in their leaders, which ultimately resulted in different performance outcomes.;

Considering the below data and the above situation please answer the below questions:

- What problem is this organization trying to solve?  
- Review the data set and determine which attributes demonstrate statistical significance (p < 0.05) and which do not. [Hint: this output is from a 2-tailed t-test. You’ll learn more about t-tests in the next module, but this should guide you on where to look for the p value in the table.]
- Based on the hypothesis stated above, what would the null hypothesis be?
- Based on the data output below, can the null hypothesis be rejected? Explain.
- Based on these data, what might be your next steps in researching/evaluating similarities and/or differences among the divisions pertaining to the attributes they look for in leaders?
- How might you use these data points to discuss with senior leaders in your organization on where to focus leadership development & training efforts? What data are missing to make a compelling case?
