Peter Drucker is noted for saying, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” In other words, the shared values, beliefs, and assumptions people hold within the organization drive how people make decisions and behave regardless of a well intentioned strategy. Hence, to become more analytical in decision-making, it requires an organization to influence its culture through adopting shared vision, goals, structures, rewards, and remediation.

This week you are tasked with assessing your organization’s culture (or a subset of the organization) in regards to data analytics. While typically culture assessments are far more reaching than a specific discipline, there is much to be learned in this exercise about how your organization values data analytics.

You will perform a mini-analysis by interviewing 2-3 key leaders in your organization. You will ask the following questions, along with any additional questions you’d like to add:

1. Describe the current state of business data analytics (using data to make better decisions) in the organization. Has a vision or future state been envisioned/developed? If so, can you describe it?
2. Are organizational leaders brought into data analytics to help drive better decision-making in the organization? What actions have you observed them put into practice to achieve the desired vision/future state of data analytics?
3. What structures, systems, and/or tools have been put in place to help the organization become more analytical with its data? What investments are being made?
4. How does the organization reinforce the use of data analytics in decision-making?
5. How has the value of data analytics been communicated to the organization?
6. Is there an executive champion for data analytics in the organization? If yes, describe their role.
7. What do you see as the biggest hurdle in becoming a more analytical, data-driven organization?

Then, using Davenport’s proficiency level chart, evaluate the current state of data analysts in your organization (or subset thereof). You may use the same interviewees to gain their assessment of the analysts in the organization or you may need to go to someone with direct knowledge of this function.

1. Do we have dedicated data analysts (100% of their time or is analysis one of many functions of their job)? Types of analysts (e.g., primarily financial)?
2. What is the desired future state of analysts in the organization (e.g., move to more dedicated analysts, ad-hoc analysts, increasing skills/competencies in specific areas, etc.)? 

Based on your interviews determine the strengths and weaknesses of your organization’s culture and skillset in becoming more data analytics driven in its decision-making. What do you see as the bright spots? What are the biggest challenges that must be overcome?

Your submission must include your interview notes (interviewee names are not required, but position is) and your final analysis/insights. There are no page limit requirements. Your submission should follow APA guidelines.

1. Describe the current state of business data analytics (using data to make better decisions) in the organization. Has a vision or future state been envisioned/developed? If so, can you describe it?
	1. Laura Miller - The current state of business data analytics is that we have a established process that is embedded in decision making via governance groups, cyclical review processes, and ad hoc analyses when needed to drive decisions. With the change in leadership, this year has been key in making sure analytics continue to have a front and center role in decision making within the appropriate conversations and groups. A future state includes the use of data analytics at lower levels of decision making (currently, most analytics reside with the President’s/Provost’s Cabinets, Directors/Department Chairs), additionally more dynamic reports with analytics for decision making without the need for Institutional Research personnel to be at the table to drive decisions. With some new software being implemented over the next several years, this capability has the potential to grow from analytics at the fingertips of President’s Cabinet to most employees.
2. Are organizational leaders brought into data analytics to help drive better decision-making in the organization? What actions have you observed them put into practice to achieve the desired vision/future state of data analytics?
	1. Laura Miller - Above I’ve discussed that analytics are used most at the highest level of the organization for decision making. This level has embraced analytics for decisions. The actions in place include bringing analytics to the table when making decisions, investing in the appropriate personnel and software to develop and ease the use of analytics.
3. What structures, systems, and/or tools have been put in place to help the organization become more analytical with its data? What investments are being made?
	1. Laura Miller - We use Rapid Insight, Power BI, Cognos, and Excel to develop our analytics. The use of analytics is embedded in certain decision making such as the development and discontinuation of an academic program. There are cyclical review processes where these analytics are provided and acted upon. There are also groups that dive deeper into analytics when this cyclical review process identifies anything concerning or fruitful. Investments center around software and personnel. Oracle Fusion Cloud is being implemented now and has robust analytic capabilities where we hope to be able to provide analytics to more employees beyond the upper level of Cabinet and Directors.
4. How does the organization reinforce the use of data analytics in decision-making?
	1. Allen Snook - The university relies heavily on our enrollment analytics when targeting our recruitment efforts for new students.  Our student satisfaction data is used to ensure we do whatever we can to retain our student through tot graduation.
	2. Laura - Procedures of making certain decisions embed the necessary data analytics required in order to fully vet the decisions. Processes are developed to ensure analytics can be provided in a timely manner to enable nimbleness in decision making. Analytics are used heavily in new program development, discontinuation of programs, retention/student success, enrollment and financial aid, and donor relations.
5. How has the value of data analytics been communicated to the organization?
	1. Allen Snook -We use parts of the Data to inform the university of where we are in our enrollment goals.
	2. Laura - Data analytics have been communicated the most during prioritization times to be transparent about how we arrived at our decisions of where we cut expenses. The value of data analytics have been communicated most to the highest level decision makers (President’s/Provost’s Cabinets, Board of Trustees, Deans/Department Chairs). Typically there is a fall state of higher education presentation led by the President and VP for Finance & Planning as well as a budget presentation by the VP for Finance & Planning during the spring that tries to convey the analytics driving our budget decisions.
6. Is there an executive champion for data analytics in the organization? If yes, describe their role.
	1. Allen Snook - Director of IR and her team. Their role is to report the outlook of student demographics that are used to project our student enrollment, student satisfaction, and diversity.
	2. Laura - Yes, the AVP for IR & IT. My role in this capacity is to ensure the right data is provided in a timely fashion to the appropriate personnel when making decisions. Additionally, I lead the predictive modeling of enrollment, financial aid, retention, and budget. The IR team is tasked with remaining knowledgeable about the current and future state of higher ed, how our competitors are performing, how our analytics in various aspects of the institution are tracking, and alerting the appropriate decisions makers when necessary.
7. What do you see as the biggest hurdle in becoming a more analytical, data-driven organization?
	1. Allen Snook - Data Storage, and compliance with all the regulations we have to adhere to.
	2. Laura - The biggest hurdles are having the personnel to maintain the analytics we have as well as develop new analytics given our switch to a new system (Oracle Fusion Cloud) as our data will be split among various systems over the next few years which will lead to analysis taking more time and may lead to additional data clean-up as we need to have accurate comparisons across systems. There’s always the concern of data loss with a new system. And, with decision making at the highest level, we have a lot of changes in the highest level occurring (President’s Cabinet and President) which has the potential to impact the analytical nature of our organization.
