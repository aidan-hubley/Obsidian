Peter Drucker is noted for saying, “Culture eats strategy for breakfast.” In other words, the shared values, beliefs, and assumptions people hold within the organization drive how people make decisions and behave regardless of a well intentioned strategy. Hence, to become more analytical in decision-making, it requires an organization to influence its culture through adopting shared vision, goals, structures, rewards, and remediation.

This week you are tasked with assessing your organization’s culture (or a subset of the organization) in regards to data analytics. While typically culture assessments are far more reaching than a specific discipline, there is much to be learned in this exercise about how your organization values data analytics.

You will perform a mini-analysis by interviewing 2-3 key leaders in your organization. You will ask the following questions, along with any additional questions you’d like to add:

1. Describe the current state of business data analytics (using data to make better decisions) in the organization. Has a vision or future state been envisioned/developed? If so, can you describe it?
2. Are organizational leaders brought into data analytics to help drive better decision-making in the organization? What actions have you observed them put into practice to achieve the desired vision/future state of data analytics?
3. What structures, systems, and/or tools have been put in place to help the organization become more analytical with its data? What investments are being made?
4. How does the organization reinforce the use of data analytics in decision-making?
5. How has the value of data analytics been communicated to the organization?
6. Is there an executive champion for data analytics in the organization? If yes, describe their role.
7. What do you see as the biggest hurdle in becoming a more analytical, data-driven organization?

Then, using Davenport’s proficiency level chart, evaluate the current state of data analysts in your organization (or subset thereof). You may use the same interviewees to gain their assessment of the analysts in the organization or you may need to go to someone with direct knowledge of this function.

1. Do we have dedicated data analysts (100% of their time or is analysis one of many functions of their job)? Types of analysts (e.g., primarily financial)?
2. What is the desired future state of analysts in the organization (e.g., move to more dedicated analysts, ad-hoc analysts, increasing skills/competencies in specific areas, etc.)? 

Based on your interviews determine the strengths and weaknesses of your organization’s culture and skillset in becoming more data analytics driven in its decision-making. What do you see as the bright spots? What are the biggest challenges that must be overcome?

Your submission must include your interview notes (interviewee names are not required, but position is) and your final analysis/insights. There are no page limit requirements. Your submission should follow APA guidelines.
