The construction company that you consulted with in Module 1 has asked you to come back to conduct more research to determine why its safety performance is better at its nuclear plants than coal plants. While the company realizes there are design and material differences between the two types of plants, it believes there may be other factors that are creating the disparity in performance. Particularly, they’re concerned that the organizational culture between the two types of plants is significantly different. In other words, what is valued and rewarded for may differ between the two groups, which are affecting how employees behave and make decisions in the field regarding the importance of safety.

Based on the company’s feedback you decided to conduct a series of interviews with randomly selected employees from both nuclear and coal plants. (Note: You can assume that the number of subjects in this study is sufficient in size to make generalizations to the broader population.) Listed below are your field notes for two specific questions you asked. You asked your subjects to validate your notes to ensure you properly captured their responses. Now, look for common ideas, concepts, behaviors, interactions, terminology or phrases in the coal subjects’ responses. Then do the same for the nuclear subjects. Then compare/contrast the two groups and explain similarities and differences (you might use a table to illustrate this). See if you can determine what might account for the differences in safety performance between the two types of plants based on the subjects’ responses. List and explain your conclusions. Then make recommendations based on your findings.

#### Category of Analysis: Performance Drivers  
Participant Group: Nuclear  
Question(s): How is performance evaluated or measured at your plant and what  
constitutes success?  
- Subject 1  
	- Schedule—adherence and compliance  
	- Cost and budget—validated against estimates; cost tracking; histograms for staffing levels—money drives the utilities  
	- Safety—types of events  
- Subject 2  
	- Performance measured against Institute of Nuclear Power Operations (INPO) equation:  
		- Safety—measured by incident rates

#### Category of Analysis: Organizational Culture  
Participant Group: Coal  
Question(s): If I were to define organizational culture as an enduring set of values,  
beliefs, and assumptions that characterize organizations and their members, how would  
you describe the organizational culture of your plant?  
- Subject 1  
	- Quality focused  
	- Reliability  
- Subject 2  
	- Forced to manage outages to an outage readiness process—tied to bonuses  
	- Bottom line number focused  
- Subject 3:  
	- Grassroots they want someone to come in and do what they said they were going to do (they value honesty); get it done on time; live up to what you said you would do  
	- None of them have any money so budget is everything and budget is driving behaviors now. Lack of power demand is resulting in lack of money.
	- If plants could turn around performance in safety, outage duration efficiency, and capacity factor it could make them more profitable. However, it is subject to the leadership—who sees it at the time and whether or not they are going to drive it. Most fossil plants are LLCs—so you are dealing with several customers under one umbrella and there is no consistent behavior.  
- Subject 4
	- Culture varies between plants  
		- Plant A  
			- Unkempt  
			- Poor paint  
			- Run-down  
			- Cheap  
			- Do not have nice facilities for their contractors  
			- Employee morale is low  
		- Plant B  
			- Clean  
			- Spend money on upgrades  
			- Putting in bag houses to stay compliant  
			- Great facilities for contractors  
			- Employee morale is high  
- Subject 5  
	- Do it as cheap as you can  
	- Looking to simply meet availability forecasts (e.g., if their goal is based on 85% capacity and you meet it then you are golden) 
	- Git er done mentality (i.e., get it done as quick as you can)  
	- Safety is lip service; they will push contractors until their safety numbers are bad. Then they will go get another contractor with a lower number and push them.  
	- Unwilling to invest in safety training, personnel, etc.  
	- Bonus-focused—leaders are focused specifically on what drives their bonuses
- Subject 6  
	- Fragmented organizational structure—you can be onsite with six bosses; they are currently pushing to have a more centralized structure  
- Subject 7  
	- Constantly evaluating performance based on scorecards, which affects fee
- Subject 8
	- False sense of management ability—management believes they have greater insight into how to do things than they really do 
	- Punitive culture—defer blame to contractors 
#### Category of Analysis: Organizational Culture  
Participant Group: Nuclear  
Question(s): If I were to define organizational culture as an enduring set of values,  
beliefs, and assumptions that characterize organizations and their members, how would  
you describe the organizational culture of your plant?  
- Subject 1  
	- Strong  
	- Based on objectives, goals, and targets—plants measure performance against these (safety, cost, schedule, budget, unit performance, etc.)  
- Subject 2  
	- Prides themselves in living their values (safety, integrity, performance excellence)  
	- Focus is on the good of the plant  
- Subject 3  
	- Culture is a reflection of the leadership—those plants that do well have dynamic leadership with the right combination of knowledge, experience, and respect in the organization  
	- Other leaders may be process-driven, but do not have the ability to connect with the people to really influence 
	- Leadership change is frequent in the industry and can create flux in the culture  
- Subject 4  
	- Plant A that I support has a culture of accountability; it is procedurally driven, accountable to safety, schedule and cost performance, and striving for continuous improvement. If you are not performing you will hear about it.
	- Plant B that I support has a culture of “this is how we have always done it”; they are satisfied with their performance. The level of engagement is not what you would expect from their management.  
- Subject 5  
	- We have a culture that believes we can do it ourselves—we designed and built the plants, procured the land, etc.  
	- We tend to be known as a culture of nepotism 
	- Pretty hard to get fired here for performance; they will move you around as opposed to terminating you. However, they will terminate you if compromise their values of safety and integrity. Safety is core to their organization. Every meeting starts with a safety message.  
- Subject 6  
	- It varies based on the utility. For example, Utility A that I support has:  
		- A strong culture around nuclear, radiological, and industrial safety  
		- Due to executive leadership, there is a focus on performance; for example, a Site VP was replaced after the site experienced several forced outages  
	- At Utility B middle-level managers do not walk the talk and do not follow through. The utility is currently purging personnel to change the culture.  
- Subject 7  
	- It’s a culture that emphasizes safety and rewards employees for such. Performance excellence is expected.
