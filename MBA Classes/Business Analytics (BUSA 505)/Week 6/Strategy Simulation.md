[[Strategic Decision Making Simulation Case]]
#### Prompt: 
You have just been hired as a brand manager at Kelsey-White, an American multinational consumer goods company. Recently the firm invested in the development of K-W Vision, a series of systems and processes that allow the use of up-to-date data and advanced analytics to drive informed decision making about K-W brands. It is 2019. The system is populated with 4 years of historical data.

As brand manager for K-W’s Blue laundry detergent, you are tasked to lead the brand's turnaround. Use the Vision platform to develop your strategy and grow Blue’s market share over the next 4 years.

Use the K-W Vision dashboard, reports and data explorer screens to identify issues and opportunities for Blue in the U.S. market. Make decisions that support the Blue brand:

- Predict market demand and set production
- Set channel price
- Make formulation decisions
- Determine promotional spending decisions
- Communicate your strategy to your managers

The simulation begins in 2019. Make decisions for 4 years, ending in 2022.

Instructions for running the simulation:

1. Click on the Data Analytics Simulation you downloaded in your Harvard course pack.
2. Click Run Simulation
3. Download and read the How to Play Guide (contained in the simulation)
4. Download and read the Data Driven Management of Blue Detergent (PDF) (contained in the simulation)
5. Now you’re ready to begin analyzing the historical data and to begin making decisions. Use the analytical results of each year to inform your strategy for the next year. Do this for 4 years.

At the end of the module your professor will share all of the results. In the next module you will have a discussion on your results and strategy - what worked, what didn't, and why.
