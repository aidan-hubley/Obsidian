	The first four questions are meant to validate our understanding of statistical concepts and do not require use of the dataset.

1. When would you use a t-test to analyze data?
	1. A t-test is used to compare means between two groups of data, it's helpful when the sample size is small or the standard deviation is unknown.
2. Describe the difference between a single-tailed and two-tailed t-test.
	1. A one-tailed t-test is used when you have specific direction for the difference between the means.
	2. A two-tailed t-test is used when you don't have a direction but still want the difference.
3. What is the difference between a t-test and ANOVA?
	1. A t-test compares the means of two groups.
	2. ANOVA compares the means of three or more groups, it determines if there is an overall difference between the groups.
4. Explain the difference between an independent t-test and a paired t-test.
	1. An independent t-test compares the means of two independent groups.
	2. A paired t-test compares the means of two related groups.

	The next set of questions will enable us to assess the Treatment Group Results vs Placebo Group Results aspect of the study.

5. Is there a significant difference between the average ages of patients that received the treatment drug versus the placebo?

  6, 7, & 8:  Is there a significant difference between the Treatment Group Results across weeks?

- Hint: You will need a total of 3 statistical tests to complete these questions
- Hint: Start by comparing weeks 2 and 4
- Hint: You will not be comparing all weeks in a single test until the next question.

9. Considering the results of Q6-8 now run a test that allows us to compare all weeks at the same time for the Treatment Group Results.  When describing what the result of this test means be sure to state it in a way that compares/contrasts the Q9 result vs the Q6-Q8 results where it makes sense to do so.  Let’s also see what this test shows us for the Placebo Group Results.
10. Let’s try one final approach with these Treatment Group & Placebo Group Results. Please add an additional column to the tab within the spreadsheet that houses this data.  In that column, add up the results from weeks 2 through 8 for all of the respondents in both groups.  Now, compare the added up results for the Treatment Group and the Placebo Group.  Is there a significant difference between those who received the Placebo vs those who received the experimental drug treatment?

	The next set of questions will allow us to examine the Pain Level & Side effect data.
	
11. Looking at Group A and Group B separately, consider the fact that each person experiences (to a certain degree) a level of pain and a side effect of some sort.  For each group run a test that can tell us if there are differences between the patients themselves and then, separately the pain levels and side effects.  Do results vary by patient to such a degree that we may need to learn more about the specific patients and classify them based on unique characteristics not presented in this data before re-running results?  Do higher pain levels imply higher degrees of side effects?

12. Now let’s think about how we proceeded for Q11 and ask what would happen if we combined Groups A & B into a single “supergroup”.  We want to perform another test that will tell us if there are not only differences between patients and pain levels vs side effects but this test should also tell us if anything about the how if at all the patients interact with the pain levels and side effects.  Please run that test and share your observations.

	After answering the above questions it is time to summarize your results for the Board.
	
13. The last question for this assignment will enable you to provide your recommendations to the Board of Directors. Be sure to communicate in terminology that the Board members can understand while, in doing so, ensure that the key reasons for your recommendation around spending more money on research is backed by the results of your own research on the data provided.  The letter should not exceed one page in length.
