#BusinessAnalytics
In an original post (not to exceed 250 words) describe how your organization currently uses business analytics and where it can improve. Be as specific as possible.

Then respond to 2 of your colleagues' posts (250 word limit post), challenging assumptions and pressing the conversation deeper. Use the literature, both provided in the course and through your own research, to support your ideas.  You are required to post a minimum of 3 times.

My organization, Messiah University, utilizes internal analytics for current students and faculty and externally through advertisements for graduates/alumni. Messiah excels at gathering and analyzing data about their courses, specifically student's experience with every course. They utilize an IDEA evaluation system to serve and report on every undergraduate-level course for each student. The detailed multiple-choice questions/text area questions speak to the depth at which the University is interested in querying and analyzing this data. Messiah collects data in a variety of layouts, types, and structures. Most notably, I have developed many of Messiah's custom websites, and the analytical data collected through my code is raw data, usually in the form of JSON or PHP arrays. More traditional structures of data, such as spreadsheet, pdf, and txt are created when we serve the data to users, clients, students, donors, etc. I believe many of Messiah's analytical processes are currently handled by expensive 3rd party systems such as dynamic forms, while they could be handled in-house by the expertise of the ITS department (where I work). The financial cost of deep data analysis is usually overlooked and I see an efficient alternative option that negates the price tag of 3rd-party services.

### Samantha's Post:
As a current restaurant employee, I rarely have access to organizational data in the course of my job. However, out of curiosity I have asked my managers questions about how senior management uses data analytics to make business decisions and they have offered to give me access to that data. For example, our franchise has been encouraging servers to use table kiosks to ring in drink and appetizer orders in the interest of increasing speed of service and table turnover. The analysis that was performed on the table turnover and speed of service concluded that using the table kiosk did increase the rate with which servers could complete tables. Most of my coworkers, however, believe that this practice actually slows them down, in part because the kiosks take longer to load, are unreliable in sending orders and as a payment method, and don't interface well with pre-existing order entry systems. What I'd be curious about is what metric the franchise chose to judge speed of service. In Chapter 6 of _Know the Difference Between Your Data and Your Metrics,_ Bladt and Filbin describe how the metric an organization chooses to focus on affects how managers direct their employees. If the franchise focuses on one measure of speed of service, the kiosk will appear to be more efficient, but taking into account the bigger picture might affect the metrics that it makes sense to manage to.

Hello Samantha,   
Thank you for your post! I appreciate you being curious and reaching out to your managers to ask for more information. I think it's fascinating to see how data can be interpreted differently, even within the same organization. I liked your observation about the potential disconnect between the data-driven decision and the ground-level working reality. It's important to remember that the choice of metrics can significantly influence behavior. In your case, focusing on table turnover rate unfortunately may have overlooked other factors like efficiency or customer satisfaction. It's notable to consider the potential biases in data collection and analysis. Something I think of in this area is the potential loss of nuances like annoyance or customer complaints when data is collected through automated systems. I'm curious if there is a more balanced approach, combining quantitative data with qualitative comments or feedback from customers. I think by engaging in open dialogue and critical thinking, we can make informed choices and analyses that support everyone.

### Lance's Post

Reading through this week’s literature the difference between companies that compete with analytics and companies that simply use them as needed is quite stark, and I think maybe in our authors’ haste and desire to lay out the case for being an analytics forward company they may have glossed too quickly over the reasons many companies fall behind (Davenport, 2010).  I get it though, I wish I could use them much more efficiently and for a better purpose than I do.  The reality is, my only opportunities to input and compile data are when my business is slow- which is not a good thing, and therefore I rarely get a chance to perform any useful data analysis.  

Nonetheless, a few key examples do jump out as I’ve had time over the years to analyze the performance of my crews and the tenders we win.  I mentioned in last week’s post that I had a realization about one of my crews that returned significantly higher profits on a specific type of construction job than on others, and it would have been beneficial to know this much earlier and deploy them much more discerningly, it would have created an opportunity for higher profits, or an opportunity to grow as I hired other crews to do other types of jobs.  One metric we regularly track is our revenue per employee- hourly, weekly, monthly, and annually.  It helps inform hiring decisions and task deployments, and could offer valuable insight for growth as well, as while you would expect revenues to temporarily go down as you hire new employees and train them, a metric could be developed for a reasonable timeline for return to expected revenue per employee proving successful and sustainable growth.  Finally, one thing I have barely scratched the surface of but would love to dig in to more is the correlation between the months in which tenders are awarded and the months in which the job actually commences.  For example, March and February are always slow, while July-October is always overbooked.  Being able to analyze the expected progress from tender to commencement could inform the aggressiveness and margins with which a tender is submitted, and confidently project a more consistent schedule and revenue per employee across the entire calendar year.

Again though, there are a lot of barriers to a small company like mine being able to leverage the data and analysis in these ways, and ironically the very things I would like to know more about- time and money- also present the largest obstacles to doing so.

Hi Lance,

I appreciate your candid reflection on the challenges of implementing data analytics in a small business. Your insights about the limitations and opportunities are spot on. It's clear that you've already identified some key areas where data analysis could significantly impact your business. Your observations about crew performance and timing are particularly insightful. I respect you looking into these areas, and I think you'll gain valuable insights to optimize your operation. I agree that the barriers to data-driven decision-making can be challenging, especially for a small business like yours. Prioritizing and focusing on the most important areas can help. Thank you for your insightful post!
