There is allotted time each week of this course to develop a Business Analytics Plan for your organization or organization of choice (see Syllabus). This project will be due at the end of Module 8 and can focus on the organization as a whole or a subset of the organization (e.g., business line, division, department, etc.).

This project should focus on how your organization could more effectively leverage business analytics to improve decision-making and drive success. Each module's theme should be incorporated into the plan. You'll notice that the assignments and discussions each week are related to this project. Therefore, use this work as applicable for your plan.

Your Business Analytics Plan should include the following:

- Describe the current state business/organizational challenges and how business analytics might help solve these challenges
- Utilize Davenport's DELTA model to frame your Business Analytics Plan
- Cover the following areas:
    - Gathering Data - Assess the uniqueness, quality, integration, access and governance of your organization's data and how it can mature in this area.
    - Measuring & Analyzing the Right Things (Targets) - What are your organizational processes, and which ones could most benefit from an analytical focus?
    - Leadership and Enterprise.  Assess your current leadership focus on analytics and what your organization can do to foster a more enterprise approach to data analytics
    - Embedding Data Analytics Into Business Processes - Where might analytics be built into business processes?
    - Data Visualization -  How might data be visualized to make better decisions?
    - The Human Side of Analytics - Assess the culture and analyst capabilities in the organization to determine fit/resistance to the plan/model you're recommending

There are no page limits on this assignment. You may develop this as a white paper or a presentation (via Powerpoint with notes or via a recorded presentation with powerpoint slides). Presentations however must include narration as if presenting your plan to an executive team. If a white paper is chosen, you must follow APA guidelines for formatting and citations. The use of visual illustrations, charts, diagrams and similar visuals is encouraged.
