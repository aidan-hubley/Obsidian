[[Create an Analytics Process Model.canvas|Create an Analytics Process Model]]
The purpose of this assignment is to identify the data your organization needs to effectively implement analytics and make better decisions. Leverage your work to date in the course and your Business Analytics Project work to determine the following:

1. What are the data requirements (i.e., data needed) to effectively measure what you've proposed thus far?
    - Note: To date you have identified the following:
        - Where your organization could improve in using business analytics
        - How your organization might be more intentional/specific in what it measures
        - Critical to Customer Needs, Drivers, and Measures
        - Identification of opportunities where analytics could be embedded into business processes
2. Are these data currently captured somewhere? If so, where?Â If these data are not currently captured, how might they be captured? (Create/describe the process.)
3. How might the data be structured (organized) and made available to decision-makers? Describe the process for making the data useable for decision-making.

Use the information from this assignment in your Business Analytics Project (BAP). In your BAP, not only do you want to make a compelling case for what needs to be measured, but you also want to illustrate where the data resides and how you intend to capture it and analyze it.
