I learned a lot from Procter & Gamble's use of data analytics and I'm inspired by the improvements they made because of their strong analytical strategy. A big takeaway for me is the value of making data accessible and centralized for all employees, with appropriate security measures. Avoiding data silos is crucial to maintaining well informed workers. Within my organization I manage an internship that current has 14 interns (starting next year, 22 interns). Training these interns to be data literate and expected/valuing data-based decisions will lead them to become strong professionals. Implementing the strategies and takeaways I have from Proctor & Gamble's case study will allow me to better lead my internship and educate my interns to value efficiency and collaboration while also maintaining a data-driven and analytical approach to problem solving.
