#### My Submission
I learned a lot from Procter & Gamble's use of data analytics and I'm inspired by the improvements they made because of their strong analytical strategy. A big takeaway for me is the value of making data accessible and centralized for all employees, with appropriate security measures. Avoiding data silos is crucial to maintaining well informed workers. Within my organization I manage an internship that current has 14 interns (starting next year, 22 interns). Training these interns to be data literate and expected/valuing data-based decisions will lead them to become strong professionals. Implementing the strategies and takeaways I have from Proctor & Gamble's case study will allow me to better lead my internship and educate my interns to value efficiency and collaboration while also maintaining a data-driven and analytical approach to problem solving.

After considering the various initiatives in the case study, there's definitely a few takeaways I have on what could be useful to pursue in my organization. The first initiative I think could be incredibly helpful is the centralization of data and analytics. Centralization is important for an organization to have consistent and trustworthy access to data, which can alternatively become messy and unreliable when stored in multiple places. For decision makers in an organization like mine to make good use of data and analytics, they need to be accessible and reliable.

Another key takeaway I had from the case study was how a cultural transformation is possible through reducing the need for hierarchical decision-making, giving more power through data to leaders further down the chain of command. In my organization, there is a governing body (think board of directors), but then many leaders under them. With a shift in culture stemming from more intentional usage of data analytics, leaders under the governance of the main board could have more access to data to empower them to make decisions on their level that are influenced by the agreed upon "truth" in the data that the top level leaders are using.

##### My Response to David:
Hello David, thank you for your post. I agree with your points about the importance of data centralization. I know my organization would deeply benefit from a more data-driven culture. Reliable, accessible data is crucial for effective decision-making across all levels of the organization.  

However, it's important to note that simply centralizing data isn't enough. Creating a culture where data is actively used to inform strategy and operations is the biggest takeaway I took from this weeks readings. This involves training employees to understand and more importantly interpret data, as well as providing them with the tools and resources they need to use data effectively. As Davenport argues, a successful data-driven organization requires a combination of technological capabilities and organizational behaviors.

I enjoyed reading this case study about Procter & Gamble and learning about the ways that they utilize business analytics to improve the operations of the company. It is clear that it is essential for analytics to be at the center of an organization because it is impossible to make informed decisions without them. I could certainly see ways in which my organization could benefit from an increased use of business analytics. 

The part that I felt could be most beneficial to my organization is the idea of Analytics as a Centralized Service. I find that my organization has good data, but sometimes there is not much of a rhyme or reason to where it is. If I am looking for information on a certain client, then there might be several places that I have to check to see if that information is there, which is not very efficient. I also appreciate how there is a location where best practices are documented. Sometimes I run into an issue at work that I know that someone would have faced before, but I have to track down that individual to see how they did a task. That employee also may have left the company, but if there is a centralized place where best practices are stored, we would be able to save a lot of time and effort.
