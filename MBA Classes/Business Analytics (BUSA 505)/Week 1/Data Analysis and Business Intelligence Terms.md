- **Raw Data** = Data in its smallest form that allows Excel Data Analysis features and excel data analysis techniques to work
- **Proper Data Set** = Proper table format = field names in first row and records in rows
- **Clean Raw Data** = Fix unusable raw data so that it can be used to perform data analysis
	- Examples:
		- Remove unwanted characters
		- Add needed characters
		- Split / Join data to get desired data
- **Transform Data Sets** = Fix unusable data set so that it can be used to perform data analysis
	- Examples:

		- Add, remove, or filter columns in data sets
- **Import Data** = import data form external sources (single or multiple sources) into Excel or Power Pivot's Data Model or Power BI Desktop
	- Optimally, the import will allow refreshes so that when source changes the repo output resulting from the import action will update
