### Rate Yourself on Key Business Analyst Skills & Benefits of Being Analytical

**Part 1:**  Not to exceed 200 words please rate yourself on a scale from 1-5 on each of the following characteristics.  Then, to help your fellow classmates, for those items that you grade yourself a 4 or higher at, what helped you get there?  And last but not least, pick the one or two areas you want to improve the most at.  In at least one of your response posts for part 2 of this assignment look for a fellow classmate who scores well in this area and, if you think something they said helps you thank them for it and feel welcome to ask each other additional questions to foster growth throughout the course.  For any areas where the entire class feels they need to improve l'll provide a few pointers in a follow-up video and/or during one of our mid-semester Zoom sessions.  Here are the characteristics:

**Part 2:**  In a non-AI generated, original post (not to exceed 300 words), based on the material this week, describe how you might benefit from being more analytical in your organization. Be as specific as possible. 

I currently serve as an IT Security Analyst for Messiah's Cybersecurity team and a manager for Messiah's SOC internship. The value and need for deep analysis within my security analysis responsibilities cannot be overstated. 'How many accounts were affected by X vulnerability?' What percentage of employees are lacking X security measure?' Analysis of Messiah's user base and network is the core of my position, but that analysis isn't directly about data analysis. Another aspect of my position is managing 14 interns who work within Messiah's SOC internship program. On paper, this is a deeply social / leadership-oriented responsibility, but fortunately, the interns need little managing. I have been able to automate many if not all nuances and data collection aspects of the management side of this through a website, (note: it's available to all messiah accounts and has some helpful tools, go to: socservices.messiah.edu) I manage the database and run data analysis on everything, such as: internship timesheets, intern's response time, active vs inactive time on the workstations in the SOC, and more. My boss and I benefit immensely from this automated analysis, we can monitor and support these interns while maintaining our other responsibilities.

Then respond to 2 of your colleagues' posts (300 word limit post), challenging assumptions and pressing the conversation deeper. Use the literature, both provided in the course and through your own research, to support your ideas. You are required to post a minimum of 3 times.

Your original post should be posted by Wednesday. Subsequent posts are due by the due date. Posting early in the week and before the deadline is strongly suggested to improve the discussion. Responding to your colleagues on Saturday at 11:57 p.m. does little to add to the discussion.

Also, please be sure that you are familiar with Netiquette as shown in the attached.
