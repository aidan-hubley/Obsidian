In an original post (not to exceed 250 words) describe how your organization currently uses business analytics and where it can improve. Be as specific as possible.

Then respond to 2 of your colleagues' posts (250 word limit post), challenging assumptions and pressing the conversation deeper. Use the literature, both provided in the course and through your own research, to support your ideas.Â  You are required to post a minimum of 3 times.

My organization, Messiah University, utilizes internal analytics for current students and faculty and externally through advertisements for graduates/alumni. Messiah excels at gathering and analyzing data about their courses, specifically student's experience with every course. They utilize an IDEA evaluation system to serve and report on every undergraduate-level course for each student. The detailed multiple-choice questions/text area questions speak to the depth at which the University is interested in querying and analyzing this data. Messiah collects data in a variety of layouts, types, and structures. Most notably, I have developed many of Messiah's custom websites, and the analytical data collected through my code is raw data, usually in the form of JSON or PHP arrays. More traditional structures of data, such as spreadsheet, pdf, and txt are created when we serve the data to users, clients, students, donors, etc. I believe many of Messiah's analytical processes are currently handled by expensive 3rd party systems such as dynamic forms, while they could be handled in-house by the expertise of the ITS department (where I work). The financial cost of deep data analysis is usually overlooked and I see an efficient alternative option that negates the price tag of 3rd-party services.
