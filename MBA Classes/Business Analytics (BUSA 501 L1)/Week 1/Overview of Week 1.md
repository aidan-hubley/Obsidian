#### Required Readings:
- [[HBR Guide to Data Analytics]] (Intro and Section 1- pp. 1- 32)
- [[Naked Statistics]] (Intro and Chapters 1-2- pp. ix-14) (Note: It is expected that you have a basic understanding of statistics either through undergraduate work or a Peregrine leveling course. While there will be several statistical exercises, I'm most interested in your understanding the concepts, knowing when to use statistical tools, how to perform basic computations in Excel, and what the data are telling you via analysis).
