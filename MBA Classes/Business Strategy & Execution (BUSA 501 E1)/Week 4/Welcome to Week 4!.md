## [[Overview Week 4 Notes]]

## Provided Notes and Jokes
**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

Have you ever read the book of Psalms in the Bible?  With 150 chapters, it’s the longest book in the Bible, but let me summarize it for you in one sentence.

**The theme of Psalms is, "Life is tough, but God is good."** Unfortunately, many of us have it backwards.  We think that life is always supposed to be good, but God is tough.  No – it’s the opposite.

Does your life seem too tough right now?  Are you feeling the heat?  Are you feeling a little pressure?  That just means God is working in your life.  He's testing your faith.  He's strengthening it.

In the Northeastern US, codfish are a big commercial business.  But it used to be that unlike most other fish, cod couldn’t be shipped to other parts of the US.  At first, they tried freezing the cod, but something about cod made them lose their flavor when frozen.  They experimented with shipping them alive in tanks of seawater, but that was even worse. The cod still lost its flavor, and in addition, became soft and mushy. 

Then some creative person solved the problem.

The natural enemy of the cod is the catfish, so they put catfish in the tanks with the cod, and from the time those cod left the Northeast till they reached their westernmost destination, those ornery catfish were chasing the cod all over the tank.  And you guessed it.  When the cod got there, they were as fresh as when they were first caught.  There was no loss of flavor or texture.

Each one of us is in a tank of life’s circumstances. Sometimes just being in the tank is painful. But in addition, in the tank with us are these catfish bringing tension to our lives.  Sometimes the catfish are kids, or bosses, or neighbors.

Those catfish are appointed by God. They’re all part of His project to shape your character so you’ll be more like His son Jesus.

_Not only so, but we also glory in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance; perseverance, character; and character, hope. And hope does not put us to shame, because God’s love has been poured out into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us._  Romans 5:3-5

“Dogs have no money. Isn't that amazing? They're broke their entire lives. But they get through. You know why dogs have no money? .. No pockets.”
