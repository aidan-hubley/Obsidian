1. Discuss the way in which a company's resources, capabilities, and value chain activities affect competitive advantage.
2. Rumelt (chapter 12) discusses "interesting advantages" and "value creating changes." Apply these concepts to Messiah University
	1. "For an advantage to be sustained, your competitors must not be able to duplicate it" (163)
	2. For value creating changes: One of the most important aspects of increasing value is:
		1. "broadening the extent of advantages" (169)
			1. Messiah University is constantly evaluating adding new Majors / Curriculums to branch into different areas of the higher education market. Since they have broken into the Cybersecurity Education field, their Computer Mathematics and Physics department has remarkable grown in size
		2. "creating higher demand for advantaged products or services" (169)
			1. Advertisements and free tours, merchandise and outreach programs to reach more students looking for private Christian higher education 


 The competitive advantage of a company is directly influenced by its resources, such as assets and equipment, the capabilities it has, what process or approaches it specializes in, and its value chain activities. This value chain is the line of events that determine the value of an org. To beat competitors, resources, and capabilities must align and positively influence the value chain. The concepts that Rumelt introduced, "interesting advantages" and "value-creating changes" can easily be applied to Messiah University. Messiah's strategic decision to expand its Computer Science Curriculum into the Cybersecurity Education field is a great example of how the University "broadens the extent of its advantages." (Rumelt, 2011) This is one of the four vital aspects of increasing value as an organization, and Messiah shows its interest in this way by broadening its educational offerings to more potential students (customers). Since the addition of the Cybersecurity Major, the remarkable growth of the Computer Mathematics and Physics department is a great example of the success of this strategy. Messiah's effort to reach more students through ads, free tours, and outreach programs are good examples of another factor in increasing value: "creating higher demand for advantaged products or services" (Rumelt, 2011) These initiatives show the value of the University's Christian atmosphere and like-minded community to potential students. By marketing the campus, curriculum, and unique advantages of Messiah University, the overall visibility and individual interest of students rise. These approaches are important, and it's reassuring that Messiah is invested in them, but interesting advantages are also vital. As Rumelt stated: "For an advantage to be sustained, your competitors must not be able to duplicate it" (Rumelt, 2011) Messiah's advantages are easiest compared to non-faith-based colleges and universities. A faith-based mission allows for generational commitment to the founder's ideals, in Messiah's case, the founding church's values. This deeply holds board and cabinet members to the same principles as their predecessors. While this can be mimicked in secular education, it is more black-and-white with a faith-based approach. The close-knit Christian community is a unique advantage Messiah holds over other faith-oriented colleges. The reputation Messiah has for its supportive campus culture fosters personal and professional growth as well as individual faith.

#### Sustainability as a Value Creation Opportunity
When asked how sustainability impacts long-term corporate strategy, 85% say it is primarily (53%) or partly (32%) a value creation opportunity. Value creation is also the top reason that companies are pursuing their sustainability strategy, with half rating it a very significant reason.

### Quinn's Response
In essence, a company's competitive advantage is largely based on the three categories listed above, Resources, Capabilities, and Value Chain Activities, and how they interact.  Strong resources allow your company to demonstrate better capability and vice versa, and an efficient value chain enhances both. If handled properly, resources like property, machines, or brand reputation can be utilized to give your company an edge. The ability to use these resources and others like processes and management to effectively to reach the goals set by the company ultimately allows the company to perform at its best. (Gamble, 2024). Value Chain as defined by AIMS Education is a "String of collaborating players, who work together to satisfy market demands for specific products or services" (Aims, 2016). With good resources and capabilities, the value chain activities and how well they are optimized lead to a higher quality of product or service and lower consumer prices, both, in turn, creating a competitive advantage.

As a Messiah employee working in the Conference Event services department, we contribute greatly to the overall value chain and revenue generated. Outside of academia, the university generates millions of dollars by renting out facilities for outside clients. We offer the advantage of providing housing, catering, and a large variety of facilities to best serve the groups that we host. It is in these benefits to those looking to to host an event that we create a heightened demand for the campus and its offerings (Rummelt, 2011). The department has currently streamlined this process to the point where there is a waiting list to host an event on campus during the summer months and bookings have already been solidified for the majority of the summer of 2025. Messiah's high-quality campus offerings and personable conference team has given the university a competitive edge over. number of other venues in the area.

#### Response to Quinn
Hey Quinn! I think you made some great points. I can appreciate how you succinct summarized how resources, capabilities, and value chain activities correlate and interact. I'm very grateful for your insight into how Messiah's facility renting operates as a unique advantage. As a fellow Messiah Employee I too can see where some of Messiah's advantages lay, but I was unaware of the remarkable income stream the University had within the facility renting scene. I'm reassured to hear you share about the backlog of clients on the waiting list. In a study conducted by Morgan Stanley, companies were asked how sustainable practices impacted their long-term strategies "85% say it is primarily (53%) or partly (32%) a value creation opportunity. Value creation is also the top reason that companies are pursuing their sustainability strategy, with half rating it a very significant reason." (Corporate) Sustainable practices ideally produce long term clients, in this case for Messiah, a remarkably sustainable waiting line of clients. From my perspective, board members heavily value operations that remain sustainable and provide reliable income; with value creation being a significant aspect of business strategy, I expect future of Messiah's conferences and hosting services to be very bright.

Resources can be tangible or intangible. Examples of tangible resources include assets like cash, plant, equipment, and patents. Intangible resources are brand, image, company culture, and human capital. These resources affect competitive advantage because they may be unique or different from other competitors. For example, if one company has more cash and cash equivalents than another, it can spend more for plant and equipment to produce more product or invest in new technology to make their products better than the competition. Capabilities are the "capacity of a firm to competently perform some internal activity" (Gamble et al., 2024). By being able to perform an activity better than the competition gives the company competitive advantage. A company's value chain activities provide competitive advantage by leveraging support activities and costs like Human Resources, R&D and General Admin against primary activities and costs like Operations, Distribution, and Service that lead to a Profit Margin. The value chain affects competitive advantage by creating value in the product or service. The more valuable the product or service, the more it will be sought after, giving the company a competitive advantage in the market.

I work for a food distributor. An "interesting advantage" of the company is that we work with our customers to help them design menus for their restaurants. We offer suggestions and tips at no charge. We also have a yearly Food Show where our customers get to meet our suppliers and sample new products and get deals on those products. The customers get to meet our leadership team at this event too. While we are a small company in the business, we value our relationships with our customers and by doing these yearly food shows our customers keep coming back and also refer new customers to us all the time.

Hey Scott, thank you for your post breaking down how resources, capabilities, and the value chain into good examples. I appreciate how you incorporated the concepts of support activities and primary activities, I was struggling to connect the 2 realms of concepts but this assisted me with that. 

I'm interested in the sustainability and scalability of your company's interesting advantage. I love this service that is offered for free to clients, and I imagine most if not all of them take advantage of it. How long does this service last? If the customized menu is poorly received, can it be redesigned for free? Respecting and pouring into the relationship between you and your customers is vital to sustain any business. I would like to hear how you would fit the annual Food Show in your company's value chain? Looking at Gamble's description of capabilities, as an organization's ability to perform activities through effective use of resources (Gamble, n.d.); how would describe the capabilities of these interesting advantages to be effective in their use of resources?
