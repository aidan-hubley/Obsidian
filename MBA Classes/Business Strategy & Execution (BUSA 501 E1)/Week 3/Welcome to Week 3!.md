**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

A man was praying to God and asked "God, how long is a thousand years to you?" God replied, "1 minute." The next day the man asked, "God, how much is a million dollars to you?" And God replied, "A penny." The next day the man asked, "God, can I have one of your pennies?" And God replied, "Yes, just wait a minute."
