- Drift is all around us
- So many organizations deal with this
- How to ensure that your org doesn't drift
- Not a single issue, but a number of factors

- Surprised by:
	- Underestimated the role of the Board of Directors
		- Huge impact and responsible to maintain mission
		- No margin of error for this staff
	- Power of money
		- Influential supporters must align with mission, cannot overlook commitments for funding
		- Breaking point, asked to "tone done the way we were talking about Jesus"
	- What do you celebrate
		- Must at least celebrate mission fulfillment

"If we do nothing do prevent it, it will happen to us too... doing the hard work to prevent drift."

- Practical steps
	- Make sure board process is inline
		- Made the process slower and intentional
	- Got the funder to write and share the original account of why the org exists 

How do know you are drifting: 
- "When your founder's story starts to feel like it's describing another organization"

Need clarity about the original pitch and passion
Write statement of intent, so that no charismatic individual can rally others to change mission

Core audience for book was faith based Christ centered non-profits, however almost everything applies to secular organizations
- Intentional stating purpose
- Intentionally recruiting staff
- How small steps gradually drift mission

	- Getting the incorrect person on the team is detrimental 
	- "Is this the right person?" / "Is this the best person we've seen \[for the position]?"
	- Know who you are looking for, will they fit within the culture?
	- Give the hiring committee veto power
	- More than an applicant's technical skills, are they living out the mission of the org

- What are key measurements?
	- Massive consequences for measuring the incorrect data
	- Christ-centeredness, are you rooted in the mission
	- Doing work with excellence
	- Growth, healthy things grow
		- Should be a result of other measurements succeeding 

- 5 W System
