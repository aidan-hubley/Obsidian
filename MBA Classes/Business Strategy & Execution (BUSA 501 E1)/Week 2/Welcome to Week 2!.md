## [[Overview Week 2 Notes]]

## Provided Notes and Jokes
**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

As the Apostle Paul wrote:

_Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but one receives the prize? Run in such a way that you may obtain it._  1 Corinthians 9:24 NKJ

I used to be a long-distance runner, so I identify with Paul's exhortation. I don’t want to run hard but then one day discover I've been running the wrong direction. I don’t want to work at something and then discover I've been wasting my time. I want the ultimate reward, that only a close relationship with Jesus Christ can bring me.

p.s. **Your business joke for the week:**

- _I saw a bank_ _that said it offered "24 Hour Banking." But I didn’t go in. I didn’t have that much time._uydtvijjm
