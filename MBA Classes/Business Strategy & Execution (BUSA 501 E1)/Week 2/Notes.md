#MBA #BusinessStrategyExecution
(Gamble, n.d.)
The managerial process of crafting and executing a company’s strategy is an ongoing, continuous process consisting of five integrated stages:
1. Developing a strategic vision that charts the company’s long-term direction, a mission statement that describes the company’s business, and a set of core values to guide the pursuit of the strategic vision and mission.
2. Setting objectives for measuring the company’s performance and tracking its progress in moving in the intended long-term direction.
3. Crafting a strategy for advancing the company along the path to management’s envisioned future and achieving its performance objectives.
4. Implementing and executing the chosen strategy efficiently and effectively.
5. Evaluating and analyzing the external environment and the company’s internal situation and performance to identify corrective adjustments that are needed in the company’s long-term direction, objectives, strategy, or approach to strategy execution.

"Bad strategy is not simply the absence of goof strategy. It grows out of specific misconceptions and leadership dysfunctions. Once you develop the ability to detect bad strategy, you will dramatically improve your effectiveness at judging, influencing, and creating strategy". (Rumelt, 33)
