1. Discuss the power of business integrity.
2. Discuss God’s perspective on business strategy.

Response:

Business integrity is vital for a company to thrive long-term. Building trust, and maintaining a strong reputation is important, but it's smart not to overlook the values and atmosphere of the work environment. Prioritizing ethical behaviors and transparency for employees, shareholders, and customers helps create a sustainable future. On the other hand, a lack of business integrity will inevitably lead to consequences, potentially including financial losses and damage to brand reputation. Investing in an integrity-valuing culture allows a business to build long-lasting partnerships, maintain good standing with the public, and ultimately maintain long-term success.

I believe God's perspective on business strategy is aligned with the principles of service, integrity, and stewardship. Biblically speaking, we understand that using God-given talents and resources responsibly to benefit others glorifies God. Applying this understanding means operating your business with integrity, by treating customers and employees fairly, to positively impacting society, ultimately furthering the Christian mission.  As Jess Duzer suggests, a business's profit should not be its primary goal, but rather it should be used as an asset to provide services/goods to benefit communities. God's perspective on business is likely oriented through ethical conduct, such as employee culture, safe environment standards, and avoiding actions that exploit others. Businesses can do more than financially succeed, they could and arguably should contribute to do more for the world.
