2. Discuss God’s perspective on business strategy.

Response:



I believe God's perspective on business strategy is aligned with the principles of service, integrity and stewardship. Biblically speaking, we understand that using God given talents and resources responsibly to benefit others glorifies God. Applying this understanding means to operate your business with integrity, by treating customers and employees fairly, with the goal to positively impact society, ultimately furthering the Christian mission.
