2. Discuss God’s perspective on business strategy.

Response:

Business integrity is vital for a company to thrive long-term. Building trust, and maintaining a strong reputation is important, but it's smart not to overlook the values and atmosphere of the work environment. Prioritizing ethical behaviors and transparency for employees, shareholders, and customers helps create a sustainable future. On the other hand, a lack of business integrity will inevitably lead to consequences, potentially including financial losses and damage to brand reputation. Investing in an integrity-valuing culture allows a business to build long-lasting partnerships, maintain good standing with the public, and ultimately maintain long-term success.

I believe God's perspective on business strategy is aligned with the principles of service, integrity, and stewardship. Biblically speaking, we understand that using God-given talents and resources responsibly to benefit others glorifies God. Applying this understanding means operating your business with integrity, by treating customers and employees fairly, to positively impacting society, ultimately furthering the Christian mission.  As Jess Duzer suggests, a business's profit should not be its primary goal, but rather it should be used as an asset to provide services/goods to benefit communities. God's perspective on business is likely oriented through ethical conduct, such as employee culture, safe environment standards, and avoiding actions that exploit others. Businesses can do more than financially succeed, they could and arguably should contribute to do more for the world.

## Response to Coby's Post & Quinn's Comment

While Coby and Quinn's discussion provides valuable insights into the importance of business integrity, I'd like to challenge some of their assumptions and delve deeper into the complexities of this issue.

Firstly, while it's true that unethical practices can lead to financial penalties and damage public perception, it's worth noting that in some cases, companies may be able to recover from such setbacks. For example, if a company can successfully address the issue and implement meaningful reforms, it may be able to regain consumer trust and even strengthen its market position.

Secondly, the idea that Christian-founded businesses are inherently more ethical is a complex one. While faith-based values can certainly provide a strong foundation for ethical behavior, it's important to recognize that individuals and organizations can interpret and apply those values in different ways. Additionally, external pressures and market forces can sometimes lead even well-intentioned businesses to engage in questionable practices.

Finally, I'd like to explore the concept of "ethical relativism" in the context of business. While there are certain universal ethical principles that apply to all businesses, cultural and societal factors can also influence what is considered acceptable or unacceptable behavior. This raises the question of how businesses can navigate these complexities and develop ethical practices that are both sustainable and culturally sensitive.
