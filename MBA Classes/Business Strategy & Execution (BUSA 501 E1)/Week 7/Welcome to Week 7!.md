**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

Someone once told me about a quick quiz that will measure how you really value yourself. You just ask yourself one question; here it is:

How would I feel about myself right now if I was old and ugly, alone and broke?

Stop for a second and think about that… how would you feel about yourself?

Here’s the problem. If your self-worth is built on the “4 A’s” of appearance, achievement, affluence, or admiration of others, then you will feel worthless if you lose those. And if your self-worth is built on the 4 A’s then you don’t understand your true value. Your true value cannot be lost or taken from you, because it is built on something eternal --- what God thinks of you. Unlike self-worth, your true value will never change because it is based upon a God who doesn’t ever change, a God who valued you so highly that he sent his only son to die for you and redeem you to be his own child.

_The LORD your God is with you, the Mighty Warrior who saves. He will take great delight in you; in his love he will no longer rebuke you, but will rejoice over you with singing.”_ Zephaniah 3:17

p.s. Your business jokes for this week:

- I once owned a paper business, but it folded.
- I reached the office this morning and the boss stormed up to me and said, ‘you missed work yesterday, didn’t you?’ I said ‘No, not particularly.’
