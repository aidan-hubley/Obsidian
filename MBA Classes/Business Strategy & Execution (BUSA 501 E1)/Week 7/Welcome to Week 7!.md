## [[Overview Week 7 Notes]]

## Provided Notes and Jokes

**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

Someone told me once that, you really only have two choices when it comes to responding to life’s difficulties.

- You’ll either grow up --- or you’ll give up.
- Your problems will either make you bitter --- or better.
- You’ll either become what God wants you to be --- or you’ll turn away from Him, and your heart will become hard.

It’s your choice.

When I go through difficult times, what happens to me is not nearly as important as what happens through me.  The circumstances of my life are not nearly as important as what happens inside of me in response to those circumstances, because that’s what I take into eternity.  The circumstances are temporary.  What I take with me is the character developed in me, and that lasts forever.

_Consider it pure joy, my brothers and sisters, whenever you face trials of many kinds,  because you know that the testing of your faith produces perseverance. Let perseverance finish its work so that you may be mature and complete, not lacking anything._  James 1:2-5 (NIV)

p.s. Your business jokes for this week:

A stockbroker called their client and said, "I have bad news and worse news, which would you like to hear first?"   
“The bad news,” the client says.  
“If you don’t act quickly, all your money will be gone in 24 hours.”  
“Oh my goodness,” the client says. “What’s the worse news?”  
“I should have made this call yesterday.”
