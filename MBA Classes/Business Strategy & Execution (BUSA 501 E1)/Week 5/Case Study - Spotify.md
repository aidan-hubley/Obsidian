### Competitive Resources and Capabilities


### Cost Structure and Customer Value Proposition


### [[5 generic competitive strategies]]

1. A low-cost provider strategy—striving to achieve lower overall costs than rivals and appealing to a broad spectrum of customers, usually by underpricing rivals.
2. A broad differentiation strategy—seeking to differentiate the company’s product or service from rivals’ in ways that will appeal to a broad spectrum of buyers.
3. A focused low-cost strategy—concentrating on a narrow buyer segment (or market niche) and outcompeting rivals by having lower costs than rivals and thus being able to serve niche members at a lower price.
4. A focused differentiation strategy—concentrating on a narrow buyer segment (or market niche) and outcompeting rivals by offering niche members customized attributes that meet their tastes and requirements better than rivals’ products.
5. A best-cost provider strategy—giving customers more value for the money by satisfying buyers’ expectations on key quality/features/performance/service attributes while beating their price expectations. This option is a hybrid strategy that blends elements of low-cost provider and differentiation strategies; the aim is to have the lowest (best) costs and prices among sellers offering products with comparable differentiating attributes.
### [[Strategic Timing Vertical Horizontal Integration]]

**Horizontal scope** is the range of product and service segments that a firm serves within its focal market.

**Vertical scope** is the extent to which a firm’s internal activities encompass one, some, many, or all of the activities that make up an industry’s entire value chain system, ranging from raw-material production to final sales and service activities.

### Conclusion 


Notes:
- Growth through Acquisitions - "Spotify strengthened its competitive position through a series of targeted and timely acquisitions. Each acquisition resulted in a stronger competitive position and new market opportunities."
- Growth through Partnerships - "Spotify also relied on strategic partnerships to strengthen its competitive position. Each partnership expanded its market access and strategic collaborations mostly through bundling of services."
- Use of Big Data - "Spotify was continuously looking for new “habits in their streaming intelligence” to learn more about how people stream content. The company called this “understanding people through music.” The company’s use of innovation and technology created superior products and services to meet the growing demand of existing and potential subscribers. Spotify introduced Spotify.me, a data analytics program to capture a subscriber’s listening habits. The captured data allowed the company to generate content that users consider in line with their tastes, creating a unique user experience and keeping users engaged. Spotify’s use of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms was a driving force behind the company’s success."
- Strategic Situation in 2022
	- "Spotify ended 2021 with strong MAU growth, continued momentum in subscription business, and meaningful advertising revenue. MAUs grew 18 percent year-over-year during the fourth quarter of 2021, and premium subscribers grew 16 percent year-over-year during the fourth quarter of 2021. The growth had allowed the company’s revenues to more than double since 2017 and achieve a gross margin of 26.5 percent during its last quarter of the year. However, while the company’s net losses had been reduced, the company had yet to achieve profitability. The company’s income statements for 2017 through 2021 are presented in Exhibit 4. The company’s balance sheets for 2020 and 2021 are presented in Exhibit 5. 
	- Spotify’s fastest growing platforms were TV and video game console users, while car and commute consumption decreased as COVID-19 had led to greater work-from-home listeners. Also, podcast listening grew in popularity in 2021 and 2022. The company achieved double-digit growth during 2021 in all geographic markets, led by strong results in India and Indonesia. Latin America also outperformed expectations. Page 334 
	- Revenue from premium subscriptions accounted for 87.5 percent of total revenues in 2021, although ad-supported revenues had grown by 62 percent between 2020 and 2021 to reach €1.2 billion. In addition, the gross margin for ad-supported revenues had increased from 1 percent in 2020 to 10 percent in 2021. Exhibit 6 presents Spotify Technology’s revenues, cost of revenue, gross profit, and gross margin by revenue source for 2019 through 2021. 
	- Beyond Spotify’s flawed profit formula and cost structure, several internal and external issues needed managerial attention. Spotify capitalized on a strong brand image, unsurpassed innovation, an expansive music library, a strong international presence, and the advantage of being an early mover in this industry. However, it also had weaknesses, such as limited options for artists to build their popularity because of the platforms licensing deals with record labels. The company’s growth in expenditures was not likely to become lessened as the company continued to pursue emerging markets, acquisitions, partnerships, and continued to focus on user experience. Also of concern was competition from other streaming platforms, which also offered subscribers and listeners an appealing mix of features and broad audio libraries. The company’s chief managers were required to continue pursuing its aggressive growth strategy, provide enhancements to its user experience, and address growing competition and flaws in its profit formula to meet the expectations of investors."
