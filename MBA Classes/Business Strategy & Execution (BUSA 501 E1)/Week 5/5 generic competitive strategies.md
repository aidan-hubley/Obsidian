1. A low-cost provider strategy—striving to achieve lower overall costs than rivals and appealing to a broad spectrum of customers, usually by underpricing rivals.
2. A broad differentiation strategy—seeking to differentiate the company’s product or service from rivals’ in ways that will appeal to a broad spectrum of buyers.
3. A focused low-cost strategy—concentrating on a narrow buyer segment (or market niche) and outcompeting rivals by having lower costs than rivals and thus being able to serve niche members at a lower price.
4. A focused differentiation strategy—concentrating on a narrow buyer segment (or market niche) and outcompeting rivals by offering niche members customized attributes that meet their tastes and requirements better than rivals’ products.
5. A best-cost provider strategy—giving customers more value for the money by satisfying buyers’ expectations on key quality/features/performance/service attributes while beating their price expectations. This option is a hybrid strategy that blends elements of low-cost provider and differentiation strategies; the aim is to have the lowest (best) costs and prices among sellers offering products with comparable differentiating attributes.
