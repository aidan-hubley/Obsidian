**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

The bible tells us that Moses saw the invisible God.

_By faith (Moses) left Egypt, not fearing the king’s anger; he persevered because he saw him who is invisible._ Hebrews 11:27-28 (NIV)

Imagine that you could see God next to you.  He’s right over there on His throne.  It’s so bright and glorious you can hardly look at Him, but you see him there. But in addition, it’s like He’s got a traveling throne and everywhere you go he’s always right there. And you can talk to Him anytime you want. Anytime your faith is weak, you just turn to Him…

_“Hey God, I don’t understand this, should I still obey?”_ 

_“Yes Ken, you’ll understand it later.”_

  _“Hey God, I don’t know if I can do this thing.”_ 

_“You can do it Ken, if you depend on my strength. Just keep your eyes on me.”_

_“Hey God, I'm worn out and discouraged, I feel like giving up.”_  

_“Now Ken, I didn’t give up on you, did I?”_

We’d have a lot more faith wouldn’t we, if we saw him sitting right there with us?

He is right there.  He is in the room with you right now.

Moses persevered because he saw him who is invisible.

We can see Him too, through faith.

# And when you see Him who is invisible, God gives you the strength to keep on working on your marriage or other relationships. He gives you the persistence to keep on working toward that God-given goal. He gives you the patience to keep loving your kids or family members. 

We can accomplish the impossible only when we see Him who is invisible, by faith.

Blessings,

Ken

p.s. Your business jokes for this week:

- I'm not saying my banker is bad at his job… but when I went into his office and asked him to check my balance, he tried to push me over.

- I had a horrible day at work, the computers went down and everything had to be done manually. It took me ten minutes just to shuffle the cards for solitaire. [Links to an external site.](http://mikekerr.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/Tired_Businessman-forehead-on-desk.jpg)
