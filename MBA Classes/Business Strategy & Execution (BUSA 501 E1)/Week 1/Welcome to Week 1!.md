## Provided Notes and Jokes
**Faith Integration Notes (and a joke)**

In 1983 Steve Jobs, the founder of Apple Computers, asked John Scully, president of the Pepsi Cola Corporation, to leave Pepsi and become the president of Apple, which at the time was one tenth the size of Pepsi.

Why in the world would John Scully ever consider what looked to many like a demotion? 

John Scully said that what changed his mind is when Steve Jobs asked him, "Do you want to spend the rest of your life selling sugar water, or do you want to change the world?"

Scully went for it.

Everyone wants their life to have meaning and value and make a difference.

So what are you going to do with the rest of your life? I suggest you center your life around Jesus Christ, and let God make something great of the rest of your life.

_Now to him who is able to do immeasurably more than all we ask or imagine, according to his power that is at work within us, to him be glory in the church and in Christ Jesus throughout all generations, for ever and ever! Amen._  Ephesians 3:20-21

p.s. **Your business joke for the week:**

An accountant fresh out of college is interviewed by the owner of a small business. The owner says, "This business is getting to be too much for me. I need someone with an accounting degree to worry about money matters.”

“OK,” says the accountant. “How much are you offering?”

“You can start at $75,000 a year,” says the owner.

“That’s a great salary!” says the young accountant. “How can a business like yours afford to pay so much?”

“That,” says the owner, “is your first worry.”
