1. Discuss the process of effectively executing strategy.
2. Discuss the power of design vs the power of focus (see Rumelt chapters 9-10).


To execute strategy effectively, a company must take a multifaceted approach that values design and focus. The design is a roadmap that provides structure while the focus element orients resources towards a concentrated point on the most important critical aspects of the business. Design includes creating a plan, with detailed goals, that describe their required resources. It also requires implementing supportive policies and procedures that align with the company and its design elements. Want your company to be strategically successful? Rumelt suggests: 

"Many companies, especially large complex companies, don't have strategies. At the core, strategy is about focus" (Rumelt, 150) What does he mean by focus? Focus on the other hand is concentrating on specific priorities, ensuring effects are pointed towards objectives and critical infrastructure. This includes setting clear objectives at all levels, managing and setting resources strategically, and maintaining accountability. A successful strategy execution requires a balance between design and focus, consider the 8 components of strategy execution that feature elements: resource allocation, leadership, corporate culture, and organizational capabilities. (Gamble, 2024)

By effectively combining design and focus, companies create environments that can effectively execute strategy. They develop a clear understanding of the strategic plan while remaining focused on the most critical efforts of the organization.
