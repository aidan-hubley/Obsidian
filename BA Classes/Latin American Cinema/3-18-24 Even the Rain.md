## A Confluence of Cinematic & Historical Temporalities 

- A meta cinematic approach
- A Mexican film crew in Bolivia shooting an historic drama on Christopher Columbus's conquest
- Water riots in Bolivia a background (2000)
- Old European Imperialism / recent waves of corporate exploitation (which involve international film production)

## Different Cinematic Tendencies
- Hollywood epics
- Digital documentaries on the 'water  war' in Cochabamba
- 1960s new waves of Latin American Cinema
- Argument: Cinema should maintain a dual role of witness on contemporary abuses and preservation of memory

## Friedrich Nietzsche’s “Eternal Return”  
- “This life as you now live it and have lived it, you will have to live once more and innumerable times more; and there will be nothing new in it, but every pain, every joy and every thought and everything unutterably small or great in your life will have to return to you....The eternal hourglass of existence is turned upside down again and again, and you with it, speck of dust!” (1882)         
## Ouroboros
- Even the Rain includes some visual samplings of a recent historical event, the Cochabamba riots, that needs to be repeated, retold, and reframed in an endless hermeneutic process over a decade later, and that in turn evokes the specter of Columbus in an endless game of mirrors.  
- If the classic cinematic time of a historic drama can be geometrically imagined as a straight line composed of scenes chronologically progressing toward a climax, the narrative time of Even the Rain is circular—the story of colonialism loops like a snake devouring its own tail/tale.


# Assignment Questions:
- How does the film portray different imbalances between the ‘visible’ countries in the global Latin American film market and ‘invisible’ countries? Why is the Mexican director paying the Bolivian extras two dollars per day? Why did he shoot his film in Bolivia in the first place?


- How does _Even the Rain_ establish parallels between old European imperialism (considered by many the first invasion of globalization) and recent waves of corporate exploitation in Bolivia?
 
- Why does _Even the Rain_ discuss these issues via a meta-cinematic approach (a film within the film)? What is the movie trying to say about the status of contemporary Latin American Cinema? How does this film problematize Che Guevara's dream of Latin America as a "united America" and a single mestizo race? In answering this question, think about Che's famous farewell to Peru in _The Motorcycle Diaries_: "Even though we are too insignificant to be spokesmen for such a noble cause, we believe, and this journey has only confirmed this belief, that the division of America into unstable and illusory nations is a complete fiction. We are one single mestizo race from Mexico to the Magellan Straits. And so, to free ourselves from narrow-minded provincialism, I propose a toast to Peru and a united America."

Water privatization came to Bolivia as a theory, on the  
wings of foreign coercion. The World Bank officials who  
pushed the plan to bring in multinational corporations  
proclaim that it would deliver three things that  
impoverished countries desperately needed – strong  
managers, skilled technical experts, and investment in  
expansion service...In Cochabamba, however, the theory  
didn’t work out quite the way its proponents said it would
