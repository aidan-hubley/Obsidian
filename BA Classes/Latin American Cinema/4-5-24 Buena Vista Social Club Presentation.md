# Filmmaking Process
- Ry Cooder and Wim Wenders collaborated on Paris, Texas (1984)
- Cooder scored this film
- Also scored The End of Violence (1997)
- Cooder gave Wenders a cassette of Buena Vista Social Club
- Wenders asked to go with Cooders to film a documentary
	- in 1998
	- 2 years after the BVSC project began
	- During the recording of Ibrahim Ferrer's debut album

- Wenders left Cuba with 50 hours of footage
- Filmed live performances in Amsterdam and Carnegie Hall
- Shot on high-def video not film stock
	- Blurred movements
	- Pixelated
	- Associated with subjective quality of experience
	- Our impression of a foreign country is an "imaginative construction" made of what we are presented with and our own biases

- DISCUSSION:
	- Is the filming style intentional for symbolic meaning or just because of the resources he has available?
		- Likely made a symbolic purpose out of the lack of resources

# Criticism and Impact
- Documentary took the BVSC album to international audiences
	- Huge factor in making it a best seller for 10 years
- Rejuvenated the music and the world music industry
- Displaces the generic salsa that was common of international ideas of Cuban Music
- Critiques contrast the Old Havana and New York scenes
	- Seemed to depict the musicians to be stuck in pre-revolutionary times
	- Implied that Cuban did not value their cultural heritage by forgetting these figures
- The musicians did not like how they were depicted
- Gonzalez claimed that Wenders has a gray vision of the world and Cuba
	- He also suggests that the album is not special and that there are 30 other BVSCs in Cuba

- DISCUSSION: Thoughts on the positive impact vs the criticism of the documentary?
	- The documentary's impact on the world's perspective outweighs the criticism
	- The misrepresentation while negative do tend to bring upon more popularity, worth it?

- DISCUSSION: Did Cooder treat the BVSC in the same Colonial Explorer Mode as present in Even the Rain?
	- Not in the same intention but potentionaly by accident.
	- He built them up through their musical career
	- What is the difference between exploiting and appreciating? Do you leave it better than you find it?
