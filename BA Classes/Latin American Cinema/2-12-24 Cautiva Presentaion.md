## Music
- Powerful score, moving violin in minor 
- What does this add to the movie?
	- Adds movement with melancholy 
	- Unending feeling, seemingly no measure count
		- Reflecting her mindset, the rabbit hole is deeper than she expects 
- Empty version of the theme played in her mother's room

	- Emotion
- Both are very somber and eerie
