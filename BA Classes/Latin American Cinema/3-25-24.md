## "For an Imperfect Cinema"
- Age of the three worlds and "Third Cinema"
	- Third World: Analogy with French Revolution
	- Frist Estate (nobility) / Second Estate (clergy) / Third Estate (common people)
	- "First World" (capitalist countries) / Second World (socialist bloc) / Third World
	- Emphasize colonial domination
	- Desire to avoid developmental (the economically "underdeveloped"), racial (the non-white), geographical (East or South) categories

### Julio Garcia Espinosa
- Solanos and Getino: "Towards a Third Cinema" (1969)
	- First Cinema (Hollywood, etc) / Second Cinema (art cinema) / Third Cinema (revolutionary cinema)

- Glauder Rocha: "Aesthetics of Hunger" (1965)
- Espinosa: "For an Imperfect Cinema" (1969)
- "Nowadays, perfect cinema - technically and artistically masterful - is almost always reactionary cinema. The major temptation facing Cuban cinema at this time - when it is achieving its time - when it is achieving its objective of becoming a cinema . . . " 
- Contemporary dilemma: Illusion that art is "uncommitted" activity; illusion of commitment
