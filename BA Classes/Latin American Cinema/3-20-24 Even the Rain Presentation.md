# History / Real World
- Anti-Government protests occurred in Cochabamba in 2000 after the sale of Bolivia's water rights to a private multinational consortium led by International Water Limited

# Basic Plot Intro
- Start with hiring a bunch of locals, they were only paid $2 a day
- Locals were also protesting and revolting the water bill hikes (due to the sale of water rights to multinational comp)

# Conflict
- As the production picks up so do the water bill protest. The lead local actor in the movie (Daniel) is leading the protests too
- Daniel and director (Sebastian) and producer (Costa) argue over what is more important

# Character Comparisons
### Columbus and Sebastian
- Wanted to break the standards and status quo of their day
- Misses the bigger picture and effects o their goal
- Saw their work as revolutionary and world changing (i.e. more important)
### Daniel and The Tribe Leader
- Earned his people's respect
- Sought to protect them however necessary
- In the end, didn't care about his own safety or anyone else besides his family / friends / people
- "I despise your god" - Tribe Leader
### Sebastian vs. Costa
- Ultimately Sebastian shows true colors (like Columbus) that all he cares about his
- Costa learns that the film comes second to these people's needs

# Impactful Scene
- Crew watching the riots on the news at the hotel
- What do you think the impact of this scene is on the film?
- Do you think this is where Costa started to realize the current water war is more important than the movie?
- Or did this start at another point in the film?

# Conclusion
- Even though it has been over two decades since the Cochabamba Water Wars and the removal of multinational corporations, Bolivia still faces water issues
- In 2017, Bolivia reported to be in its worst drought in 25 years
