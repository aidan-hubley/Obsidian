- Andrew Lyle's Presentation on Che - Protagonist in Motorcycle Diaries 

# Che

## Where has Che gotten? (by the end of the movie)
- He will go on to be a communist 

- By the end Che claims to "not be myself anymore"
	- This is the opposite from standard coming of ages structures

## Why does the movie resonate with those in their early 20s?

### Even if I wanted to change the world, why couldn't I?
- Inability to do things
- Lack a skill that could help people
- We don't know about the way the world actually works
- We don't know who we are
- We are over attached to our stuff 
- We lack motivation
- We have certain things that we have to worry will flare up

### Part 1: The Dissolve
- Girlfriend represents attachments
	- Moving on from your past, it's relationships,
- Motorcycle is a symbol of status / independence
	- fast paced, upon losing it, Che is forced slow down and reflect 
- Money represents what he relies on
	- Relying on Family, friends, money holds you back from 
- Asthma relates to an insecurity 
	- Overstimulation, physical limits, medical conditions

- Between Alberto and Che over whether he is being too idealistic, if the world really does move on manipulation (Alberto's belief) or on Kindness (Che's belief)
- Will they even survive?
- Will Che be able to make an impact?
- Whether he will get back for the girlfriend?
- If he will find what he is looking for?

- Che allows himself to be formed by the environment around him, without compromising his moral (caring, not lying to someone else's loss)

### Part 2: Waking Up
- Lost money, relationships, and the motorcycle

- Walking forces him to reflect and connect with his environment
- No distractions from girlfriend

#### Mise-en-Scene
- it is a concept of how the surroundings themselves influence the story
- By this point in the story, we see that there is nothing left in Che's life. Alberto is ready to quit, but Che keeps rolling on. What is the difference?
- Che has been changed by the land, Instead of ...

#### Further Scenes
- Che notices injustices, takes them in and can be affected by them
- Che learns who he is, but there is single tension remaining the Asthma

### Part 3: Wake Up
- Journey's over
- He knows who he is, no gloves for the Leper colony
- He swims across the Nile with asthma


# How is this applicable?
- What do you need to let go to allow the world to impact you?
- Want to be like Che or Alberto?

- If you want to live a life of meaning, you must let go of these things...
