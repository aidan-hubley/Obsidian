- Overthrown by Fidel Castro in 1959
	- Communis, thousands fled to the US
- Cuban exiles, with JFK's help, overthrow Fidel Castro to establish non-communist government
- Invasion took place in 1961, called The Bay of Pigs Invasion
## Bay of Pigs Invasion

- Bombed southern coast
- Invasion was a failure
- Exiles surreneded, many killed 1100 exiles takes as prisoners

## Impact on Sergio
- His wife lest him to go to Florida
- Impending fear of foreign invasion
- Cynical about revolution
- Elitist mentality and overly critical of those around him
- He is detached and isolated from others

# Sergio's Perspective
- Sergio thrived in the pre-revolutionary system
	- Didn't feel like he needed to leave with his family
- He often looks down on others, literally and metaphorically
	- Shown through how he looks down from his balcony / throw a telescope

- Sergio is the narrator
- Like reading a book in first person, audience is getting a skewed idea of his experience through his perspective
- Telescope scene
	- Several instances where Sergio is observing the city
		- The Bronze titan, a statue of Antonia Maceo, military leader who stood against Spanish colonial rule, a symbol of independence
		- The Imperial Eagle, was removed during the Revolution in 1959
		- City of Havana, cityscape, kids playing, couple on lounge chairs
- What he sees
	- Gathered symbols that represent the revolution
	- "Nothing has changed here"
	- "But everything seems so different today. Have I changed or has the city?"
		- DICUSSION: 
			- His perspective, through the binoculars, on the city is still the same, no destruction, but in his life everything has changed 
			- Alternatively, the city is changing but he isn't, he recognizes that something is different but can't tell if he is changing or if the city is

- DICUSSION: What does Sergio dropping the dead bird from his balcony symbolize?
	- 3 birds in a the cage, 2 alive representing US and Russia, the dead one represents Cuba
	- Sergio is very numb when removing the dead bird

- Relationship with women
	- We see short clips of his daydreams throughout the film
	- Views of women as intellectually and culturally underdeveloped, similar to how he views the country of Cuba to be underdeveloped
		- Elena is a young, virgin girl who Sergio feels that he can tale advantage of 
		- Scene in which Sergio is hiding from Elena pitying her for being lower than him

- Is Sergio is the who is underdeveloped?
	- Unhealthy relationships
	- Struggles to engage with the world around him
	- He is removed, distant, and isolated

DICUSCCION:
- Does Sergio realize he is a hypocrite in his criticism of everyone else's underdevelopment?
	- He doesn't realize it, he is too high on the pedestal to be self-aware, he is a narcist 
- Why was he adamant about staying in Cuba? What kind of statement was he truing to make in staying?
	- He is in support of the revolution, he was development
	- He was projecting his unsatisfaction about his decision onto other people
	- He might have stayed because Cuba changed in a way he wasn't happy with
	- He wanted to fix Cuba after his family left, but the everything he wanted to fix, Cuba's underdevelopment, is his biggest flaw, he is underdeveloped, and that's why he couldn't leave with his family

# Film Elements
- Real Footage
	- Black and white images of Fidel Castro and JFK woven throughout the fictional story
	- Made a more authentic film
	- Similar to the film NO

- Camera Angles
	- POV shots 
		- Seeing Elena through Sergio's eyes
		- Shots looking down from the balcony, Sergio believes he is superior to everyone else
	- Combination of narrating and camera angles makes the audience feel more immersed and invested in the story

- One of the unique things about this film is the perspective of a man who is unattached from Cuban identity and revolution, telling a story from this POV highlights the imperfections of a society and gives the audience the opportunity to question
