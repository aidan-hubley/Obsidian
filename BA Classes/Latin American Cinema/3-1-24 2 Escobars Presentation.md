# Pablo in The Two Escobars
- A family man
- Passionate about Soccer
	- Supportive of Columbian Soccer
	- Friends with National team
- Won lower class house of representatives for 4 years
- Ideology: "Why don't the rich in Columbia help the poor"
	- Gave the poor Soccer fields

- Made a living smuggling drugs / money laundering
- Murder of a referee for Columbia to win a soccer game
- Killed over 1000 cops in his career
- Arrested by DAS (Essentially FBI in Columbia)
- Put his family in danger
	- Family members murdered for his actions
- Killed for his actions

# Pablo in Narcos
- Ideology is split between family and business
- Family
	- Cares for his wife
	- Cares about the opinion of his father
	- Clearly hurt when his father calls him a murderer / disappointed in him
- Business
	- Willing to manipulate to get what he wants (Think to his interaction with the police in outing "Cockroach")
	- Will kill to make a buck
	- Uses his charisma to manipulate anyone

# Pablo Quotes
- "The boss was dead, so everyone became their own boss"
- "Anything illegal, you asked for Pablo's permission"
- "When Pablo died, the earth shook. You couldn't trust anyone"
- "In Columbia, soccer was a religion ... everyone was too caught up in winning to notice (Pablo)"

# How one goes broke: "Slowly at first, then all at once"
- Think about how this could apply to Marcos from *Nine Queens*?
	- Marcos, ultimately is conned into giving $200,000 towards the end of the film
	- He fails to cash the check by the end
- Marcos was leaking money during this quest to make a profit from the nine queens stamps
- At the end of this movie, he is seen being unable to cash his check; he lost nearly everything
- Both Pablo and Marcos gamble with their lives in different ways


# Andres Escobar
- Wanted to give Columbia a voice against Violence
	- Wanted to give Columbia a better representative as a whole
- Andres was known as "The Gentleman"
	- Calm both on and off the field
- Devout Catholic
- Conscious of his impact; think about the aftermath of the self goal

## Self Goal


## Andres and Pablo
- Both family men, and passionate about Soccer
- Opposite morals, similar and different in many different ways


# Parallel Storytelling
- Andres was intent on ending violence
- Pablo was intent to starting violence

- Both were murdered

- Andres might not have been murdered if Pablo were alive

## Seen in Narcos
- Steve Murphy and Pablo Escobar
	- Murphy and Escobar's stories are similar
		- He hunts Pablo
- Murphy sees Pablo as the bad guy, Pablo challenges that idea

## Lines Blurred
- The line between Good vs. Evil is blurred through the story of Narcos

# Final Discussion
- Does Andres get murdered after his self-goal? 
- Violence rates: Do they go up or down within the next 3 years? What about the next 30?
- Do things still get better in Columbia like they are today, or does Pablo being alive prolong Columbia's downfall? ()
