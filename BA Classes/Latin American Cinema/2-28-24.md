# Magical Realism
- Defined as what happens when a highly detailed, realistic setting is invaded by something too strange to believe

- Like Water for Chocolate (Alfonso Arau, 1992)
- Pan's Labyrinth (Guillermo Del Toro, 2006)

- Magical Realism is a literary style incorporating fantastic or mythical elements into otherwise realistic fiction
	- Colombia is where it began
	- And anyone who's spent real time here knows why
	- It's a place where the bizarre shakes hands with the inexplicable on a daily basis
	- But just like in the novels of Gabriel Garcia Marquez, the weird shit usually pops off at certain critical moments
	- When the whole place is on edge, when everything's about to change
