### Takeaways from Chapter 1:

**1.** I was very surprised to hear that in 2019 it is estimated that $114 billion was spent on cybersecurity. I can only imagine the amount spent in 2022.

**2.** "Automation and artificial intelligence have the potential to erase much of the attacker's advantage. Yet, at the same time, attackers are looking at how they can use these tools as well. Quantum computing could provide both impossible-to-break protection for data and the ability to crack all current forms of encryption." This is the future, these tools are up for grabs by both the good and bad guys, so to speak. This is the environment that I am graduating into, and I think it important to recognize the tools that I will be utilizing in the upcoming years. 

**3.** Cyberspace is unlike previous domains of conflict, it is malleable by man. We created it and therefore we control it. Cyberspace is a collective problem, meaning that the government consults with major cybersecurity companies, private firms, and venture capitalists. 

**4.** "The United States does not have a good reputation with turning the other cheek." The next war is very likely to be started by a cyberattack. To keep the cyber peace we need to think about how we improve cybersecurity.

**5.** The small potential for cyber warfare does by no means outweigh the objective benefit the internet has brought to the modern day. The factors that enable the possibility for cyber attacks also allow for social media, streaming, connectivity, online shopping, etc.

**6.** Cybersecurity is a responsibility that is shared between both governments and private sectors/companies. "Public-private partnership" While many in the upper government believe it is their responsibility to protect the nation in cyberspace, it is not, and this belief is flawed. 

**7.**  "Shifting the advantage from the attacker to the defender." This should be the focus of our nation and other like-minded nations.

### Takeaways from Chapter 2:

**1.** I have never heard of a 'wiper' before. NotPetya spread from an infected network to any connected device, wiping all software on any device it could find. Devices such as computers, routers, mobile phones, printers, etc.

**2.** There is a debate on whether the U.S. Government has to tell software developers about potential holes in their firewalls. "It is a matter of balancing the interests of intelligence agencies trying to attack with the concerns of government departments such as the Treasury and Homeland Security that have an interest in more secure corporate networks."

**3.** National Governments seem to be more focused on offense than defense. They are bloodthirsty to steal one another's attack tools.

**4.** "The U.S. military, for example, has said that it reserves the right to respond to cyberattacks with any weapon in its arsenal." That is a very American viewpoint and a very good way to escalate to war. We need to focus on putting down nation-state hackers and reducing the risk of cyber warfare.
