# Enslaved Peoples:
- Reliance in all aspects
	- Homes, school fields, mines, construction projects, entertainment  
- How enslaved were acquired  
	- Born enslaved - sons and daughters of enslaved mothers  
	- bought and sold at slave markets  
	- Others were captives subjugated by the Roman army (POWs)  
		- No distinction between combatants and civilians  
		- Sold immediately to merchants (followed the army for this purpose)  
			- Sometimes just killed (deemed best)
- Enslaved peoples - are nearly invisible in the archaeological record  
	- Few possessions, rarely identified in texts, burials rarely marked with gravestones  
	- Maybe?? some archaeological evidence - Example - burial in Britain - a fettered man  
	- Reassessment of “slave quarters” in villas

# Domus vs. Villa
- Domus " house” - found within the city  
	- architecture limited to the confines of your property  
	- Could still be quite lavish and large  
- Villa - umbrella term  
	- home built outside the city - not just luxury homes  
		- Productive elements, status symbols  
- 2nd c BCE – 1st CE - “Golden Age of Villas”  
- villa maritima (by the sea)
- villa suburbana (outside the city)
- villa rustica (farm)

- Luxury villa  
	- Found mostly south of Rome – Bay of Naples  
	- Built near water’s edge
