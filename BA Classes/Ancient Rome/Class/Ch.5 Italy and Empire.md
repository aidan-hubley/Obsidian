- Post Second Punic war – Rome’s now a global superpower  
- In the city - institutions were the chief points of power  
-  Away from the city - commanders and armies and delegations of senatorial ambassadors  
- Consuls and praetors – exercised power (imperium) – only what they were assigned  
- If assigned away from Rome = wage war or defend/assert claim

- Senate paranoid – disloyal allies  
- Investigated the cult of Bacchus (Dionysus) in 186 BCE  
	- New cult  
		- Worked outside the city’s normal religious/political framework  
		- Consul -Spurius Postumius Albinus – began investigation  
	- original senatorial decree inscribed in Bronze

- Large-scale settlement projects – punishment for disloyal and reward for loyal soldiers   
- Post Second Punic War – college of ten special magistrates – decemviri – settled veterans in Spain, Sicily, N. Africa  
- Creation of triuviri – reinforce old colonies or found new ones

- Senate assigned a lot of magistrates to the areas of Gaul (north) and Liguria (south)
	- Gaul – get rid of population and create new colonies  
	- Liguria – deporting individuals and confiscating land

- In the 3 decades between 1st and 3rd Macedonian Wars – Rome’s control over Greece  became more present reality  
	- Greeks began to assign the Roman state traditional symbols of power in their world  
		- Established cults (language and practice of religion) – goddess Roma (temples, priests, sacrifices)

- Titus Maccius Platutus (254 - 284 BCE)
	- 205-184 BCE  
	- Roman writer of comedic plays  
	- Significance – his plays are the earliest complete surviving works from Latin theater  
		- Known for development of characters and word play  
- Plautus’ works – popular after his death and continued to be performed in Rome for  another century  
- Works read, studied, copied for centuries  
- plays made reappearance during the Renaissance.

-   Following Plautus' death in the mid-180's BCE, Caecilius Statius – leading Roman comedic  playwrights  
	- Significance: Roman Hellenism on the rise (c. 170’s BCE)  
- Publius Terentius Afer  
- Terence – we know little of his life (even birth and death but we estimate his last play was 160 BCE  
	- We have all of his works – complete and all the details surrounding them  
		- We have very few authors in which we have all their works  
			- Probably held in high regard  
- Prologues – addresses the audience directly about play’s production NOT the plot (like Greek plays)  
- Adds sense of drama + gives us information about play production  
- He also flatters producers, sucks up to the audience, issues catty retorts.
