Time of Mediterranean connectivity

## Nuragic Civilization (1800 - 1200 BCE) - Sardinia

- Bay of Naples site - avellino eruption
	- Prints - hooves; carts, people
		- Preserved also 1000s of human footprints - perhaps of the population fleeing during the eruption


# Emergence of Proto-Villanovan Culture
- Deriving somewhere north
- By start of the Villanovan culture proper, there were two very different regional groups - dividing line at the Tiber

# Iron Age - Villanovan Period (1200 - 700 BC)
- Northern / central Italy
- Defined by cremating its dead and putting them into urns
- Fertile area surrounding village freed up time for other pursuits
- Horses seem to be important

# Etruscans - 8th century BC
- This area is usually called Etruria - spread from the Tiber River to parts of the Po Valley
- Main sites - Cerveteri, Chiusi, Populonia, Tarquinia, Veii, Vetulonia, and Vulci

## Prosperous and advances in areas
- Fertile lands
- Access to local natural resources - especially that of iron

##  Trade Network
- Imports - enslaved peoples, raw materials, manufactures goods (Greek Pottery)
- Exports - iron, pottery, food items - wine, olive oil, grain
- Ideas and technologies moved throughout the Mediterranean as well
## Contact amongst each other
- Not always peaceful

- Temples - often build in a sacred area; usually 3 man temples
	- Earlies structures - dried mud-brick buildings using wooden poles and thatched roofs
