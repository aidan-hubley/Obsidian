# Subqueries
## Where can Subqueries by Placed
- In a WHERE clause as a search condition
- In a HAVING clause as a search condition
- In the FROM clause as a table specification
- In the SELECT clause as a column specification

## WHERE clause
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_date, invoice_total
FROM invoices
WHERE invoice_total >
    (SELECT AVG(invoice_total)
     FROM invoices)
ORDER BY invoice_total

## In WHERE syntax
- WHERE test_expression [NOT] IN (subquery)
- WHERE expression comparison_operator [SOME ANY ALL]
	- subquery
- Comparison_operator:
	- = > < >= <= <> !=
	- Without SOME, ANY, ALL the subquery should return a single value (i.e. the result of an aggregate function)


How many rooms are currently available for booking?
(check canvas for database img)
SELECT COUNT( * )
FROM tblRooms
WHERE IngRoomID not in
	(SELECT IngRoomID
	FROM tblLink_BookingsRooms)

SELECT COUNT( * )
FROM tblRooms
	LEFT JOIN tblLink_BookingsRooms
WHERE IngBookingID IS NULL


# In FROM Clause
## Join or Subquery
### Join
- A join can include columns from both tables.
- A join is more intuitive  
when it uses an existing  
relationship.  
### Subquery  
- A subquery can pass an aggregate value to the main query. 
- A subquery is more intuitive when it uses an ad hoc relationship.
- Long, complex queries can be easier to code using subqueries.

# In SELECT Clause
- What was the last invoice made by each vendor?
