# Database Recovery
- Mechanism for restoring a database quickly and accurately after loss or damage
- Recovery facilities:
	- Backup Facilities
	- Journalizing Facilities
	- Checkpoint Facilities
	- Recovery Manager

# Backup Facilities
- Automatic dump facility that produces backup copy of the entire database
- Periodic backup (e.g. nightly, weekly)
- Cold backup - database is shut down during backup
- Hot backup - selected portion is shut down and backed up at a given time
- Backups stored in secure off-site location

# Journalizing Facilities
- Audit trail of transactions and database updates
- Transaction log - record of essential data for each transaction processed against the database
- Database change log - images of updated data
	- Before-image - copy before modification
	- After-image - copy after modification
		- Produces an **audit trail**

# Checkpoint Facilities
- DBMS periodically refuses to accept new transactions
- -> system is in a quiet state
- Database and transaction logs are synchronized
- This allows recovery manager to resume processing from short period, instead of repeating entire day

# Recovery and Restart Procedures
- Switch - Mirrored databases
- Restore/Rerun - Reprocess transactions against the backup
- Transaction Integrity - Commit or abort all transaction changes
- Backward Recovery (Rollback) - Apply before images
- Forward Recovery (Roll Forward) - Apply after images (preferable to restore/rerun)
