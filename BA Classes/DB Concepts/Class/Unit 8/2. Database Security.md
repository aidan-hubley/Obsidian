# Database Security
- **Database Security**: Protection of the data and applications against accidental or intentional loss, destruction, or misuse
- Increased difficulty due to Internet access and client/server technologies

# Threats to Data Security
- Accidental losses attributes to:
	- Human error
	- Software failure
	- Hardware failure
- Theft and fraud
- Improper data access:
	- Loss of privacy (personal data)
	- Loss of confidentiality (corporate data)
- Loss of data integrity
- Loss of availability (through e.g. sabotage)

# Data Management Software Security Features
- Views or subschemas
- Integrity controls
- Authorization rules
- User-defined procedures
- Encryption
- Authentication schemas
- Backup, journalizing, and using checkpoints

# Views
- Views are subsets of the database that is presented to one or more users
- User can be given access privilege to view without allowing access privilege to underlying tables
- Contents of view is updated each time the view is accessed

# Integrity Controls
- Protect data from unauthorized use
- Domains - set allowable values
- Assertions - enforce database conditions
	- CREATE DOMAIN PriceChange AS DECIMAL
		- CHECK (VALUE BETWEEN .001 and .15);

# Authorization Rules
- Controls incorporated in the data management system
- Restrict: 
	- Access to data
	- Actions that people can take on data
- Authorization matrix for:
	- Subjects
	- Objects
	- Actions
	- Constraints

# MySQL Security Model
- Based on Access Control Lists (ACLs) for all connections, queries and other operations
- Also includes support for SSL encrypted connections between MySQL clients and servers

# MySQL GRANT/REVOKE Statement
- Grant and Revoke operations allow DBA 

## MySQL GRANT Syntax
|Command|Defintion|
|-|-|
|ALL|Grants all privileges|
|ALTER|Allows use of ALTER TABLE|
|CREATE|Allows use of CREATE TABLE|
|DROP|Allows use of DROP TABLE|
|DELETE|Allows use of DELETE|
|EXECUTE|Allows execution of stored procedure|
|INDEX|Allows use of CREATE \| DROP INDEX|
|INSERT|Allows use of INSERT|
|UPDATE|Allow use of UPDATE|

# Encryption
- For highly sensitive data use encryption
- Encryption involves executing an encryption algorithm to scramble data so that it cannot be understood
- MySQL default is unencrypted connections between client and server
- SSL is an encryption protocol used over IP networks

# Authentication Schemes
- Goal - obtain a positive identification of user
- Passwords are flawed:
	- Users share them with each other
	- They get written down, could be copied
	- Automatic logon scripts remove need to explicitly type them in
	- Unencrypted passwords travel the Internet
- Possible solutions:
	- Biometric devices - use of fingerprints, etc. for positive ID
	- Thrid-party authentication - using secret keys, digital certifications
