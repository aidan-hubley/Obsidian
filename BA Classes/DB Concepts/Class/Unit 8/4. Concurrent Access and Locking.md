# Concurrency Control
- **Problem** - in a multi-user environment, simultaneous access to data can result in interference and data loss
- **Solution - Concurrency Control**
	- The process of managing simultaneous operations against a database so that data integrity is maintained and the operations do not interfere with each other in a multi-user environment

# Lost Update Example

# Concurrency Control Techniques
- Serializability - 
	- Finish one transaction before starting another
- Locking Mechanisms
	- The most common way of achieving serialization
	- Data that is retrieved for the purpose of updating is locked for the updater
	- No other user can perform updated until unlocked

# Locking for Concurrency Control

# Locking Mechanisms
- Locking level:
	- Database - used during database updates
	- Table - used for bulk updates
	- Record - only requested row; fairly commonly used
	- Field - requires significant overhead; impractical
- Types of locks:
	- shared lock - Read but no update permitted. Used when just reading to precent another user from placing an exclusive lock on the record
- Types of locks:
	- Shared lock - Read but no update permitted. Used when just reading to prevent another user from placing an exclusive lock on the record
	- Exclusive lock - No access permitted. Used when preparing to update

# Deadlock
- An impasse that results when two or more transactions have locked common resources, and each waits for the other to unlock their resources

# Managing Deadlock
- Deadlock prevention:
	- Lock all records required at the beginning of a transaction
	- Two-phase locking protocol
		- Growing phase
		- Shrinking phase
	- May be difficult to determine all needed resources in advance
- Deadlock Resolution:
	- Allow deadlocks to occur
	- Mechanisms for detecting and breaking them
		- Resource usage matrix

# Database Performance Tuning
- DBMS Installation
	- Setting installation parameters
- Memory Usage
	- Set cache levels
	- Choose background processes
- Input/Output Contention
	- Use striping (RAID)
	- Distribution of heavily accessed files
- CPU Usage
	- Monitor CPU load
- Application tuning
	- Modification of SQL code in applications
