# SQL Background
- SQL includes language constructs for:
	- Data Definition Language (DDL):
		- Used to define the structure and schema of a relational database
		- Commands that define a database, including creating, altering, and dropping tables and establishing constraints
	- Data Manipulation Language (DML)
		- Commands that maintain and query, insert, delete and modify data in a relational database
	- Data Control Language (DCL)
		- Commands that control a database, including administering privileges and committing data

# DDL, DML, DCL and DB Development

# DDL Command Examples
- CREATE
![[Pasted image 20220830120426.png]]
- ALTER
	- ALTER TABLE 'sakila'.'actor'
		- ADD 'State' CHAR(2) NOT NULL AFTER 'last_name' ;
- DROP
	- DROP TABLE 'sakila'.'actor' ;

# DML Command Examples
- SELECT
	- SELECT * FROM sakila.actor
		- WHERE last_name like "B%";
- INSERT
	- INSERT INTO 'sakila'.'actor' (actor_id, first_name, last_name, last_update)
		- VALUES (DEFAULT, 'Russel', 'Crowe', '2016-08-30 15:22:00');
- UPDATE
	- UPDATE 'sakila'.'actor'
		- SET last_update = "2016-08-30 14:10:00"
		- WHERE first_name = 'Russel' AND last_name = 'Crowe';
- DELETE
	- DELETE FROM 'sakila'.'actor'
		- WHERE first_name = 'Russel' AND last_name = 'Crowe';

## SELECT Example and Result
- SELECT * FROM sakila.actor
	- WHERE last_name like "B%";

## Style
- Separate clauses and indent multiple lines within a "clause"
- Bad example
![[Pasted image 20220830121454.png]]
- Good example

## Comments
- Multi-line comment (like Java and PHP)
![[Pasted image 20220830121552.png]]
- Single Line comment

# DML Select Statement
## SELECT Syntax
![[Pasted image 20220830121906.png]]
## The SELECT Statement
- Used for queries on single or multiple tables
- 5 Main Clauses of the SELECT statement
	- SELECT 
		- List the columns (and expressions) that should be returned from the query
	- WHERE
		- Indicate the conditions under which a row will be included in the result
	- GROUP BY
		- Indicate categorization of results
		- HAVING
			- Indicate the conditions under which a category (group) will be included
	- ORDER BY
		- Sorts the result according to specified criteria

# SELECT Basics
- SELECT Attribute-List     - Specifies table columns
	- FROM Table-List         - Specifies tables
	- WHERE condition;      - Specifies qualifies rows

-- ALL Columns
SELECT * FROM invoices;

-- Specific Columns and sorting
SELECT invoice_number, invoice_total,
		invoice_total
FROM invoices
ORDER BY invoice_total DESC;

-- Calculated values
SELECT invoices_id, invoice_total,
		credit_total + payment_total AS total_credits
FROM invoices
WHERE invoices_id = 17

# Arithmetic Order of Operations
![[Pasted image 20220830123207.png]]
Used parentheses to force order that you desire

# Select Attributes from a Database
- DISTINCT => removes duplicate rows from resulting table
- Attribute-List
	- All columns (use * )
	- Column names (Alias possible)
	- Calculation
	- Function
- WHERE may refer to a set of values IN or NOT IN
- WHERE may refer to a:
	- range (BETWEEN) of values
	- or partial values using the LIKE keyword
		- _ (? in MS Access) represents a single, unspecified character
		- % (* in MS Access) series of one more more unspecified characters
	- IS NULL => searches for NULL (missing) values

# Select Example with a Function
- SELECT CONCAT(" ", column name, column name)

# SELECT Example - Boolean Operators
- AND, OR, and NOT operators for customizing conditions in WHERE clause
![[Pasted image 20220830124400.png]]

- Wildcards
	- % matches any number of characters (including none)
	- _ matches exactly one character
	- Using % and _ in the match:
		- \\% matches one %
		- \\_ matches one _

# Where Clause with Logic Operators
- Syntax
	- WHERE [NOT] condition
		- [ {AND|OR} [NOT] condition ]…
- Examples
	- SELECT * FROM vendors
	- WHERE vendor_state = "NJ"
		- AND vendor_city = "Springfield";

	- SELECT * FROM invoices
	- WHERE NOT (invoices_total >= 5000
		- OR NOT invoice_date <= '2014-08-01')

- How do you rewrite this without the NOT and parenthesis?
- Order of Precedence
	- NOT
	- AND
	- OR

# Where Clause and REGEXP
- Syntax
	- WHERE *expression* [NOT] REGEXP pattern
- Special Characters:
	- ^
		- Pattern should be matched at the beginning of the expression
	- $
		- Pattern should be matched at the end of the expression
	- .
		- Place-holder for a single character
	- [charlist]
		- place-holder for a single character within the charlist
	- [char1-char2]
		- place-holder for a single character within the range of char1 to char2
	- |
		- "or" - separates two patterns and is true if either matches

- Example:
	- SELECT * FROM invoices  
	- WHERE vendor_id in (  
		- SELECT vendor_ID FROM vendors  
		- WHERE vendor_state REGEX ‘N[JY]’  
	- );

# LIMIT Clause
- Allows the selection of only certain number of rows (starting at a certain row number)
- Syntax (clause is at the end of the entire SELECT statement)
	- LIMIT [offset, ] row-count
