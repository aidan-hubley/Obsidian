## JOIN with Table Alias Syntax
![[Pasted image 20220901125652.png]]
- Note: If you use an alias, it must be used in the ON clause

## Joining with "on"
- select *
	- from vendors v
		- join invoices i **on** v.vendor_id = i.vendor_id

## Joining with "using"
- **ONLY happen when the columns are the same name**
- select *
	- from vendors v
		- join invoices i **using** (vendor_id)

## Join Table Alias Example

## Joining a Table to Itself
![[Pasted image 20220906121106.png]]
- A manager is an employee, so her employee information is stored in the employees table
- How do we find all the employees she manages?
- Think of the relationship like this:
![[Pasted image 20220901130838.png]]

Needed:
- select *
- from Employee e 
	- Join Employee AS Manager
		- On e.Manager_ID =
			- Manager.Employee_id

## Joining a table multiple ways
![[Pasted image 20220906121534.png]]
SQL:
- select *
	- from 'Match'
		- join Team as Home
			- on Home_Team_FK = Home.Team_ID
		- join Team as Away
			- on Away_Team_FK = Away.Team_ID

## Natural Join
- Joins two tables based on ALL the columns in the two tables that have the same name
- Example:
- select invoice_number, vendor_name
- from vendors
	- natural join invoices

## Union
- Combine rows from two or more SELECT statements

## Nursery Playground
![[Pasted image 20220908121609.png]]
- SELECT *
- FROM tblParents
- JOIN tblChlidParentDetails 
	- ON tblChlidParentDetails.lngParentID = tblParents.lngParentID
- JOIN tblChlidrenID
	- ON tblChlidParentDetails.lngChildID = tblChlidrenID.lngChildID
- WHERE ysnPerredContact = "true" AND strChildFirstName = "Sally" AND strChildLastName = "Jones"!

How many children are registered for each session this week?
- SELECT strSessionDayName, count( * )
- FROM tblRegister
- JOIN tblSessions 
	- USING (IngSessionID)
- WHERE NOW()
	- BETWEEN timeSessionStartTime AND timeSessionEndTime
- GroupBy IngSessionId


How much does each parent owe in nursery fees for their children?
- SELECT SUM(curSessionPrice)
- FROM tblChildParentDetails
- JOIN tblChildren
	- USING (IngChild)
- JOIN tblRegister 
	- USING (IngChild)
- JOIN tblSessions
	- USING (IngSessionID)
- GroupBy IngParentID
