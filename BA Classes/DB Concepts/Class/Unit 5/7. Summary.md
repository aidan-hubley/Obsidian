#DatabseConcepts
- The relational database model is an important conceptual structure widely used in industry
- Normalization techniques are important processes used to reduce anomalous database behavior
- But, there are limits to normalization in the real-world due to a proliferation of relations (tables) and the performance needs of database applications
- De-normalization is the process of relaxing some of the normalization rules and permitting certain anomalies to produce a database that performs well
