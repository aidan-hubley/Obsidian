- Originally the work by E. F. Codd
- Normalization is a process used to eliminate redundancy that may cause anomalies
	- Insert Anomaly
		- Information about a specific supplier cannot be added until they supply a part
	- Deletion Anomaly
		- If a row is deleted, valuable information is lost (quantity, part, and supplier information)
	- Update Anomaly
		- If a supplier moves from Harrisburg to Lancaster, then a significant number of rows must be updated (instead of rows)
- Leads to database relations (tables) that remain consistent after an operation is performed
- There are progressive number of normal forms
- Each eliminates potential anomalies but introduces a large number of small tables
- Higher the normal form, the slower the database performance => many join operations
- Normalization beyond Third Normal form is rarely used in industry
- "The rules leading up to third normal form can be summed up in a single statement: Each attribute must be a fact about the key, the whole key and nothing but the key"
- De-normalization is also important as it allows the database to have better response time for certain operations
