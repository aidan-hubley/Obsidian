- A **functional dependency** occurs when the value of one (or a set of) attribute(s) determines the value of a second (set of) attribute(s):
	- StudentID -> StudentName
	- StudentID -> (DormName, DormRoom, Fee)
- The attribute on the left side of the functional dependenct is call the determinant
- Functional dependencies may be based on equations
	- ExtendedPrice = Quantity X UnitPrice
	- (Quantity, Unit Price) -> ExtendedPrice
- Function dependencies are not equations!
## Composite Determinants
- **Composite Determinants**: A determinant of a function dependency that consists of more than one attribute
## Functional Dependency Rules
- If A -> (B, C), then
	- A -> B and
	- A -> C
- If (A, B) -> C, then
	- neither A nor B determines C by itself
