- 2ND AND
- No informational attributes depend on anything BUT the whole key

## Resolving to Third Normal Form
- Remove the attributes that depend on an informational attribute that is not the candidate key along with the determinant to their own table
- The determinant will become the candidate key of the new table
- The determinant will become the foreign key in the existing table

## Beyond Third Normal Key
- Boyce-Codd Normal Form
	- More in-depth form of 3 NF that deals with tables that have multiple candidate primary keys
	- A relational table is in BCNF if every determinant is a candidate primary key
- Domain/Key Normal Form (DK/NF)
	- A relation is in DK/NF if every constraint on the relation is expressed as logical consequence of the definition of keys and domains
	- Has no modification anomalies
	- Cannot be computed algorithmically
- 4NF
- 5NF

## Summary of 1NF to 3NF
- 1 NF
	- Any relation that does not have multi-valued attributes
- 2 NF
	- A relation is in 1 NF and every non-primary key attribute is functionally dependent on the entire primary key
- 3 NF
	- A relation is in 3 NF if it is in 2 NF and every non-primary key attribute is functionally dependent on the entire primary key and nothing but the entire primary key
