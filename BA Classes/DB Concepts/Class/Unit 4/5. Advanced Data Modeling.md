## Advanced Entities
### Generalization Hierarchy (Sub-Types)
- Def:> allows entity types that share common attributes to be generalized
- Super-Type
	- Higher Level Entity Type
	- Contains Common Attributes
- Sub-Type
	- Lower Level Entity Type
	- Contain Uncommon Attributes
	- Typically inherit all attributes of Super-Type

# Advanced Relationship
## Generalization / Hierarchy Sub-type Exclusivity
- Sub-types are either exclusive or inclusive
- Exclusive sub-types
	- **Disjoint**
	- an entity instance can be an instance of only one sub-type
	- Example: Employee on previous slide
- Inclusive sub-types
	- **Overlapping**
	- an entity can be an instance of two or more sub-types
	- Example: Person entity type in a college might have three sub-types: Faculty, Administration, and Student

# Advanced Attributes
## Identifiers
- An **identifier or key** of entity an attribute or group of attributes that uniquely determine all the instances of the entity
- The **purpose** of an identifier is to act as a handle for referring to a specific occurrence of an entity
- Identifiers are also referred to as keys
## Selecting an Identifier
- An identifier **should not change** its value over its life
	- Example: SSN, Student ID
	- Why is this important?
- Each instance of an entity should have valid, non-null **values for the identifier**
- **Avoid** the use of **intelligent identifiers** whose structure indicates classifications, locations, etc.
	- Example: first two digits of a code indicate warehouse location
- Consider **replacing a single-attribute** identifier for **large composite identifiers**
	- Example: For Game entity use Game_Number instead of Home_Team combined with Visiting_Team
## Derived Attributes
- obtain their value by performing operations on other attributes (age, etc.)
- Some say derived attribute should be included in a data model; others say they should not
	- Should: More complete model
	- Should not: Not stored in database so should not be in model

## Degree of Relationships
- Degree of a Relationship is the number of entity
