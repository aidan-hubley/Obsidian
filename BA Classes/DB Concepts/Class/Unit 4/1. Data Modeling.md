# Data Models
- A data model is a technology independent representation of the data structures and associated information required by an application
- This typically includes the following items:
	- Data entity types
	- Relationship types
	- Business Rule; constraints on the data, 
	- Possible operations on data entity types (OO)
## Database Developer Role
- Identify and understand business rules that govern data
- Represent those rules in a clear way that is understandable by developers and users
- Implement those rules in database technology
## Business Rules
- Business Rules
	- â€œstatements that define or constrain some aspect of the business. It is intended to assert business structure or to control or influence the behavior of the business. ... rules prevent, cause, or suggest things to happen."
- Business rules gathered via
	- Interviews with database via
	- observing existing processes and systems
	- reviewing organizational documents
- Do not use a Business Rule that can be depicted in the data model
- Examples:
	- "A student may register for a section of a course only if he has successfully completed the pre-reqs for that course"
	- "A preferred customer qualify for a 10% discount, unless he has an overdue account balance."
## Philosophies
- There are two popular forms of data modeling
- **ER Data Modeling** began in the late 1970s and has become somewhat popular
	- Models the world as a set of entity types, relationship types and business rules
- **OO Data Modeling** emerging in the mid-1990s through Rational Software
	- OO data modeling extending ER data modeling by adding the modeling of permission operations on data to the model
- We will cover both methods in the class but will focus on a hybrid that is heavily ER
- These modeling methods are a cornerstone of the course
## Data Modeling Perspective 
- Data modeling is an **iterative process** of stepwise refinement
	- Conceptual Design
	- Logical Design
	- Physical Design
- Data modeling requires a good understanding how the data will be used NOT just what the data is
