## OO vs. EER Data Modeling
![[Pasted image 20221103120231.png]]

## Object
- An entity that has a well-defined role in the application domain, as well as state, behavior, and identity
	- Tangible: person, place, or thing
	- Concept or Event: department, performance, marriage, registration
	- Artifact of the Design Process: user interface, controller, scheduler
## State, Behavior, Identity
- State: attribute types and values
- Behavior: how an object acts and reacts
	- Behavior is expressed through operations that can be performed on it
- Identity: every object has a unique identity, even if all of its attribute values are the same

## Operations
- A service that implements the object's behavior and is provided by all instances of a class
- Types of operations per previous slide:
	- Constructor: creates a new instance of a class
		- Available to all classes and not explicitly shown in class diagram
	- Query: access, but now alter, the state of an object
		- Available on all attributes and not explicitly shown in class diagram

## Associations
- Association
	- Relationship among object classes
	- Shown as a solid line between participating
- Association Role
	- The end of an association where it connects to a class
	- Optional role names indicate role played by class attached to end near which the name appears
- Multiplicity
	- How many objects participate in an association
	- Lower-bound...Upper bound (cardinality)

### Association Class
- An association that ahs attributes or operations of its own or that participates in relationships with other classes
- Like an associative entity in ER model

## Generalization/Specialization
- Subclass, superclass
	- similar to subtype/supertype in EER
- Common attributes, relationships, AND operations
- Abstract Class: no direct instances
- Concrete Class: direct instances

## Polymorphism
- Abstract Operation: Defines the form or protocol of the operation, but not its implementation
- Method: The implementation of an operation
- Polymorphism: The same operation may apply to two or more classes in different ways

## Aggregation
- Aggregation: A part-of relationship between a component object and an aggregate object
- Composition: A stronger form of aggregation in which a part object belongs to only one whole object and exists only as part of the whole object
- Recursive Aggregation: Composition where component object is an instance of the same class as the aggregate object
