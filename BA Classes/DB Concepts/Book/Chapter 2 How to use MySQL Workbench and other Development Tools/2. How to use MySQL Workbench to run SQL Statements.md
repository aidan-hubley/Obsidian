# How to use MySQL Workbench to run SQL Statements
## How to enter and execute a SQL statement
- When you first connect to a MySQL server in MySQL Workbench, a SQL Editor tab is automatically opened. Figure 2-7 shows how to use the SQL editor to enter and execute a SQL statement. The easiest way to open a SQL Editor tab is to click the Create New SQL Tab button in the SQL Editor toolbar or press the Ctrl+ T keys. 
- Once you open a SQL tab, you can use standard techniques to enter or edit a SQL statement. As you enter statements, you'll notice that MySQL Workbench automatically applies colors to various elements. For example, it displays keywords in blue. This makes your state1nents easier to read and understand and can help you identify coding errors. 
- To execute a single SQL statement like the one in this figure, you can press Ctrl+Enter or click the Execute Current Statement button in the SQL Editor toolbar. If the statement returns data, that data is displayed below the SQL editor in a corresponding Result grid. In this figure, for example, the result set returned by the SELECT statement is displayed. If necessary, you can adjust the height of the Result grid by dragging the bar that separates the SQL Editor tab from the Result grid. 
- Before you execute a SQL statement, make sure you've selected a database by double-clicking the database in the Navigator window. Otherwise, you'll get an error message like this: 
	- Error Code: 1046. No database selected 
- Similarly, if you haven't selected the collect database, you'll get an error message that says the table doesn't exist. For example, if the EX database is selected when you attempt to retrieve data from the Vendors table, you'll get an error message like this: 
	- Error Code: 1146. Table 'ex.vendors' doesn't exist 
- To fix this, you can double-click the AP database to select it.

### Description
- To open a new SQL tab, press Ctrl+T or click the Create New SQL Tab button ( ) in the SQL Editor toolbar. 
- To select the current database, double-click it in the Schemas tab of the Navigator window. This displays the selected database in bold. 
- To enter a SQL statement, type it into the SQL editor. 
- As you enter the text for a statement, the SQL editor applies color to various elements, such as SQL keywords, to make them easy to identify. 
- To execute a SQL statement, press Ctrl+Enter or click the Execute Current Statement button (thunderbolt 1) in the SQL Editor toolbar. If the statement retrieves data, the data is displayed in a Result grid below the SQL tab.
## How to use snippets
- You can think of the snippets that come with MySQL Workbench as a library of SQL syntax. This library is divided into statements that you can use to manage a database, define objects in a database, and manipulate the data in a database. You can also create your own snippets that provide custom code. In fact, you're more likely to create your own snippets than you are to use the built-in snippets. That's because the syntax that's provided for the built-in snippets is much more complex than what you typically need. 
- Figure 2-8 shows how to use snippets. To start, if the SQL Additions window isn't displayed, you can display it by clicking on the rightmost button at the right side of the SQL Editor tab. Then, you can display the snippets tab and use the drop-down list at the top of the tab to select a category of snippets. In this figure, for example, the My Snippets category is displayed. From here, you can select a snippet and then click the Insert Snippet button to enter the snippet into the SQL Editor tab. Finally, you can edit the snippet code so it's appropriate for your SQL statement. 
- In this figure, the snippet contains code that I wrote for joining the vendors, invoices, and invoice_line_items tables. To create this snippet, I entered it into a SQL Editor tab and then clicked the Add New Snippet button. By saving this statement as a snippet, I can now use it anytime I want to join these three tables instead of having to type it each time. 
- For now, don't worry if you don't understand the SQL statement presented in this figure. The main point is that you can use the Snippets tab to save and retrieve a variety of SQL code. As you learn more about SQL statements, you'll see how useful this can be.
### The SQL Additions tab with a snippet created by a user
![[Pasted image 20220831222555.png]]
### Description
- The SQL Additions window contains context help and snippets. Snippets contain the syntax for many common SQL statements. You can use the snippets to guide you as you create a SQL statement. You can also create your own snippets and save them for later use. 
- The SQL Additions window is displayed to the right of the SQL Editor tab by default. If this window isn't displayed, you can display it by clicking the rightmost (blue button) at the right side of the SQL Editor toolbar. Then, you can click the Snippets tab to display the available snippets.
- The snippets are organized into categories. To display any category of snippets, select the category from the drop-down list at the top of the Snippets tab. 
- To enter a snippet into a SQL editor, select the snippet and then click the Insert Snippet button (star right arrow) at the top of the Snippets tab. Then, edit the snippet code so it's appropriate for your SQL statement. 
- To replace code in the SQL editor with a snippet, select the code, select the snippet you want to replace it with, and then click the Replace Current Text button (star up arrow). 
- To create your own snippet, enter the code for the snippet into a SQL editor tab. Then, select the category where you want to save the snippet, click the Save Snippet button (star+) in the SQL Editor toolbar, and enter a name for the snippet. 
- To delete a snippet, right-click it in the Snippets tab and select the Delete Snippet item.
## How to handle Syntax error
- If an error occurs during the execution of a SQL statement, MySQL Workbench displays a message that includes the error number and a brief description of the error. In figure 2-9, for example, the message displays an error number of 1146 and a brief description that says ''Table ap.vendor doesn't exist." 
- In this example, the problem is that the Vendor table doesn't exist in the database. To fix the problem, you need to edit the SQL statement so the table is Vendors instead of Vendor. Then, you should be able to successfully run the SQL statement. 
- This figure also lists some other common causes of errors. As you can see, most e1Tors are caused by incorrect syntax. However, it's also common to get an error if you have selected the wrong database. If, for example, you have selected the EX database and you try to run a statement that refers to tables in the AP database, you will get an error. Regardless of what's causing the problem, you can usually identify and correct the problem without much trouble. In some cases, though, it may be diffict1lt to figure out the cause of an error. Then, you can usually get more information about the error by searching the Internet or by searching the MySQL Reference Manual as described later in this chapter.

### Common causes of errors
- Having the wrong database selected
- Misspelling the name of table
- Misspelling a keyword
- Omitting the closing quotation mark for a character string
### Description
- If an error occurs during the execution of a SQL statement, MySQL Workbench displays a message in the Output tab that includes an error code and a brief description of the error. 
- Most errors are caused by incorrect syntax and can be corrected without any additional assistance. Otherwise, you can usually get more information about an error by searching for the error code or description in the MySQL Reference Manual or on the Internet.
## How to open and save SQL scripts
- In MySQL, a script is a file that contains one or more SQL statements. To create a script, you enter the state1nents you want it to include into a SQL Editor tab. You'll learn more about that in the next figure. Then, you can click the Save button or press Ctrl+S to save the script as described in figure 2-10. 
- Once you've saved a script, you can open it later. To do that, you can click the Open SQL Script File button in the SQL Editor toolbar, or you can press Ctrl+Shift+O. In this figure, the dialog box that's displayed shows the script files that have been saved for chapter 2. These files are created when you download and install the source code for this book. Note that the names of these files have the .sql extension. (If you're using Windows 10 and the file extensions aren't displayed, you can display them by opening the File Explorer, displaying the View tab, and selecting the ''File name extensions'' option in the Show/hide group.) 
- Once you open a script, you can run it as shown in the next figure. You can also use it as the basis for a new SQL script. To do that, just modify it any way you want. Then, you can save it as a new script by pressing the Ctrl+Shift+S keys or selecting the Save Script As command. 
- The screen in this figure shows the tabs for two script files that have been opened. After you open two or more scripts, you can switch between them by clicking on the appropriate tab. Then, you can cut, copy, and paste code from one script to another.
### The Open SQL Script dialog box
![[Pasted image 20220831223254.png]]
### Description
- A SQL script is a file that contains one or more SQL statements. 
- To open a file that contains a SQL script, click the Open SQL Script File button in the SQL Editor toolbar or press the Ctrl+Shift+O keys. Then, use the Open SQL Script dialog box to locate and open the SQL script. 
- When you open a SQL script, MySQL Workbench displays it in its own SQL Editor tab. To switch between open scripts, select the appropriate tab. 
- To cut, copy, and paste code from one SQL script to another, use the standard techniques. 
- To save a SQL statement to a script file, click the Save button in the SQL Editor toolbar or press Ctrl+S. Then, use the Save SQL Script dialog box to specify a location and name for the file. 
- To save a script you've modified to a new file, press the Ctrl+Shift+S keys or select the Script As command.
## How to enter and execute SQL scripts
- In the last topic, you saw a SQL script that contained a single SQL statement. However, a SQL script typically contains multiple statements. Figure 2-11 shows how to enter and execute scripts like that. 
- When you code multiple SQL statements within a script, you must code a semicolon at the end of each statement. For example, this figure shows a script that contains two SELECT statements. To execute both of these statements, you can press the Ctrl+Shift+Enter keys, or you can click the Execute SQL Script button in the SQL Editor toolbar. When you do, the results of each script are displayed in a separate Result grid. To switch between Result grids, you can click on the tabs that are displayed below the current Result grid. 
- If you want to execute a single SQL statement that's stored within a script, you can do that by moving the insertion point into the statement and pressing the Ctrl+Enter keys or clicking the Execute Current Statement button. Then, if the statement retrieves data, the data is displayed in a single Result grid. 
- If you need to, you can also execute two or more statements in a script. To do that, you select the statements and then press the Ctrl+Shift+Enter keys or click the Execute SQL Script button. This is useful if a script contains many statements and you just want to execute some of them.
### A SQL script and its results
![[Pasted image 20220831223547.png]]
### Description
- When you code a script that contains more than one statement, you must code a semicolon at the end of each statement. 
- To run an entire SQL script, press the Ctrl+Shift+Enter keys or click the Execute SQL Script button (thunderbolt) that's located just to the left of the Execute Current Statement button in the SQL Editor toolbar. 
- When you run a SQL script, the results of each statement that returns data are displayed in a separate Result grid. To switch between these Result grids, you can click on the tabs that are displayed below the current Result grid. 
- To execute one SQL statement within a script, move the insertion point into that statement and press the Ctrl + Enter keys or click the Execute Current Statement button (thunderbolt 1). If the statement retrieves data, the data is displayed in a Result grid. 
- To execute two or more statements within a script, select them in the editor and then press the Ctrl+Shift+Enter keys or click the Execute SQL Script button.
