#DatabseConcepts [[2. How to use MySQL Workbench to run SQL Statements]]
#  An Introduction to MySQL Workbench
- MySQL Workbench is a free graphical tool that makes it easy to work with MySQL. We recommend using this tool as you work through this book. This chapter shows how to work with version 8.0. However, with some minor variations, the skills presented in this chapter should work for later versions as well

## The Home page of MySQL Workbench
- When you start MySQL Workbench, it displays its Home page as shown in figure 2-1. This page is divided into three tabs: Welcome, Models, and Migration. 
- The MySQL Connections section of the Welcome tab contains links that you can t1se to open a connection to a MySQL server. Then, you can use that connection to code and run SQL statements. By default, this tab contains one connection that allows you to connect as the root user to a MySQL server that's running on the local computer. In this book, this is the only connection you will need. However, if necessary, you can click the (±) icon to the right of MySQL Connections to create other connections. 
- The Welcome tab also contains links to MySQL Workbench documentation, blogs, and forums. This book doesn't show how to use these links, but you may find them useful, especially after you have learned the basic skills for working with MySQL that are described in this book. 
- The Models tab contains links that let you create a database diagram from a type of data model known as an BER model. You can also use this tab to open existing BER models or to create new ones. Then, you can work with BER diagrams that correspond with these models. To learn more about this, you can read chapter 10. 
- You can return to the Home page by clicking on the tab with the house icon on it near the top left comer of the Workbench window. In this figure, the Home tab is the only tab that's shown, but you'll see some other tabs in the next few figures.

## The Home page of MySQL Workbench
![[Pasted image 20220831172606.png]]
### Description
- The Home page of MySQL Workbench is divided into three tabs displayed at the left side of the window: Welcome, Models, and Migration.
- You can use the MySQL Connections section of the Welcome tab to start and stop the database server and to code and run SQL statements. 
- You can use the links on the Welcome tab to view the documentation for using MySQL Workbench, view the MySQL Workbench blog, and view and join in the MySQL Workbench forum. 
- You can use the Models tab to create and work with EER models. 
- You can use the Migration tab to migrate other databases to MySQL and to copy a database from one instance of MySQL to another. 
- You can return to the Home page by clicking the tab with the house icon. This tab is always displayed in the top left corner of the Workbench window.
### Note
- In some cases, you'll get an ''Unsupported Operating System'' 1nessage when you start MySQL Workbench. This happens, for example, when you start MySQL Workbench 8.0 on Windows 7. If you click the OK button when this message is displayed, MySQL Workbench should work fine. This is a known bug that should be fixed in a future release of Workbench.

## How to open a database connection
- Before you can work with a database, you need to connect to the database server. When you start MySQL Workbench, the MySQL Connections section displays a list of saved connections. 
- By default, MySQL Workbench has one saved connection in this list. This connection is named ''Local instance MySQL80'', and it connects as the root user to a MySQL server that's running on port 3306 of the local host computer. (This assumes that you're using MySQL version 8.0. If you're using another version, the number at the end of the connection name will be different.) 
- Since this is what you want when you 're first getting started, you typically use this connection to connect to the server. To do that, click the connection and enter the password for the root user if you 're prompted for it. If you installed MySQL Workbench following the directions in appendix A (Windows) or B (macOS), the password for the root user is ''sesame80." 
- Figure 2-2 shows the dialog box that MySQL Workbench displays to prompt for a password. This dialog box shows that it's attempting to use the root user to connect to a MySQL server running on port 3306 of the local host. In addition to entering a password in this dialog box, you can select the ''Save password in vault'' option to save the password so you don't have to enter it every time you connect to this server. Then, if you ever want to clear the password from the vault, you can right-click the connection, select the Edit Connection item, and click the Clear button. 
- If you need to connect as another user, or if you need to connect to a MySQL server running on a different computer, you can use MySQL Workbench to edit the connection parameters for a connection. To do that, right-click the connection and select the Edit Connections item. This displays a dialog box that lets you specify the parameters for the connection such as the username, hostname, and port number. 
- If you want to add a new connection to the Home tab, you can click the ® icon to the right of MySQL Connections, enter a name for the connection, and specify the parameters for the connection. Then, this connection appears in the list of connections, and you can click it to use it.
### The dialog box for boxing database connections
![[Pasted image 20220831173353.png]]
### Description
- To connect as the root user to an instance of MySQL that's running on the local host computer, click the stored connection named "Local instance MySQL80", and enter the password for the root user if prompted
- To save the password for a connection so you don't have to enter it every time, check the ''Save password in vault'' option when you 're prompted fo1· your password.
- To clear the password from the vault so you are prompted for your password, right-click the connection, select the Edit Connection item, click the Clear button for the password, and click the Close button. 
- To edit the connection parameters for a connection, right-click the connection, select the Edit Connection item, enter the connection parameters, and click the Close button. This lets you specify the username, the host address, the port number, and other connection parameters. 
- To add a new connection to the Welcome tab of the Home page, click the (±) icon to the right of MySQL Connections, enter the connection parameters, and click the OK button. Then, the connection appears in the list of connections.
## How to start and stop the database server
- If you installed MySQL on your computer as described in appendix A (Windows) or B (MacOS), the database server starts automatically when you start your computer. This piece of software is sometimes refe1red to as the database service or database engine. It receives SQL statements that are passed to it, processes them, and returns the results. 
- Before you can work with a MySQL database, the database server must be started. To check whether the MySQL database server is running on your computer, you can use the Startup/Shutdown option of MySQL Workbench as shown in figure 2-3. Then, if the server isn't already running, you can start it by clicking on the Start Server button. When you do that, MySQL Workbench displays a message that indicates the status of the MySQL server, and it displays the Stop Server button. 
- You may also want to stop the database server from time to time. For example, you can stop the server if you aren't going to be using it and you want to free the resources on your computer. Or, you can stop the server if the port that is being used by the MySQL database server conflicts with another program. Then, when you want to work with the database server again, you can start it. 
- The easiest way to stop the database server is to use the Stop Server button that's available from the Startup/Shutdown option of the Navigator window of MySQL Workbench as described in this figure. When you click this button, MySQL Workbench displays a message when the MySQL server has successfully stopped, and it displays the Start Server button. 
- When you're running the MySQL database server on your own computer for training purposes, you can stop the database server whenever you want. However, if a database server is running in a production environment, you should make sure that all users are logged off and that no applications are using the database server before you stop it.
### The Startup/Shutdown option of MySQL Workbench

### How to stop and start the database server
1. Display the Welcome tab of the MySQL Workbench Home page. 
2. Click the connection to the local server. This should connect you to the local MySQL server as the root user. If necessary, enter the password for the root user. 
3. In the Navigator window, if necessary, click on the Administration tab. Then, select the Startup/Shutdown option from the Instance category. 
4. Click the Stop Server button to stop the database server. Or, click the Start Server button to start it.
### Description
- After you install MySQL, the database server usually starts automatically each time you start your computer. 
- The database server can also be referred to as the database service or the database engine. 
- If you aren't able to use Workbench to start and stop the database server, you may need to edit your connection so it points to the correct instance of MySQL. To do that, right-click the connection on the Welco1ne tab of the Home page, select the Edit Connection item, click the System Profile tab, and edit the service name. For MySQL 8.0 on Windows, the service name is typically ''MySQL80''.

## How to navigate through the database objects
 - After you connect to a database server, you can use the Schemas category of the Navigator window to navigate through the database objects in the databases on the server, as shown in figure 2-4. As you can see, these objects include tables, views, stored procedures, and functions. For this chapter, however, you can focus on the tables. Later in this book, you'll learn more about views, stored procedures, and functions. 
 - In this figure, I double-clicked the node for the AP database (schema) in the Schemas tab of the Navigator window to select it and view the database objects it contains (tables, views, stored procedures, and functions). Then, I expanded the Tables node to view all of the tables in the AP database. 
 - To work with a node or an object, you can right-click it to display a context-sensitive menu. Then, you can select a command from that menu. For example, you can right-click the node for the AP database to display a list of commands for working with that database.
## The tables available for the AP database
![[Pasted image 20220831214648.png]]
### Description
- Each database (or schema) provides access to the database objects that are available. These database objects include tables, views, stored procedures, and functions. 
- On some systems, the Navigator window provides Administration and Schemas tabs that you can use to display the Administration and Schemas categories. On other systems, the Navigator window displays the Administration category above the Schemas category.
- To display the databases for the current connection, you can use the Navigator window to view the Schemas category.
- To navigate through the database objects for a database, click the arrows to the left of each of the nodes in the Navigator window to expand or collapse the node. 
- To work with a node or an object, right-click the node or object and select a command from the resulting menu.
## How to view and edit the data for a table
- To view the data for a table, you can right-click the table name and select the Select Rows - Limit 1000 command. In figure 2-5, for example, I selected this command for the Invoices table. This displayed the data for the table in a Result grid. In addition, it displayed information about the SELECT statement that was used to retrieve the data in the Output tab. 
- To insert, edit, and delete the rows in the table, you can use the buttons at the top of the Result grid. Then, to apply the changes to the table, you can click the Apply button at the bottom of the Result grid. Or, if you want to cancel the changes, you can click the Revert button.
### The data for the Invoices table displayed in the Result grid
![[Pasted image 20220831214917.png]]
### Description
- To view the data for a table, right-click the table in the Navigator window and select the Select Rows - Limit 1000 comn1and to display it in a Result grid. 
- To edit the data for a table, view the data. Then, you can use the buttons at the top of the Result grid to insert, update, and delete rows. 
- To apply the changes to the table, click the Apply button at the bottom of the tab. To cancel the changes, click the Revert button.
## How to view and edit the column definitions for a table
- If you want to edit a column definition for a table, you can use the technique described in figure 2-6 to display the column definitions for the table. In this figure, for example, the column definitions for the Vendors table are displayed. At this point, you can view information about each column of the table such as its name and data type. 
- Once you display the column definitions for a table, you can use the Columns tab to add a column, delete a column, or modify a column. For example, you can add a new column by entering it at the bottom of the list. You can delete a column by right-clicking on it and selecting the Delete command. You can change the name of a column by selecting the column and then clicking on the name and editing it. You can change the data type of a column by selecting the column and then clicking on its data type and selecting another data type from the drop-down list that appears. And so on. 
- Most of the time, you won't want to use MySQL Workbench to edit the column definitions for a table. Instead, you'll want to edit the scripts that create the database so you can easily recreate the database later. In chapter 11, you'll learn more about creating and modifying the column definitions for a table using both techniques.
### The column definitions for the Vendors table
![[Pasted image 20220831215321.png]]
### Description
- To view the column definitions for a table, right-click the table name in the Navigator window and select the Alter Table command. Then, select the Columns tab at the bottom of the window that's displayed to view the column definitions for the table. 
- To edit the column definitions for a table, view the column definitions. Then, you can t1se the resulting window to add new columns and modify and delete existing columns.
