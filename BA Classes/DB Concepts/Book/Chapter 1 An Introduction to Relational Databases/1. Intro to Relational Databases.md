### The Three Hardware Components of a Client/Server System
1. The **clients** are usually the PCs that are already available on the desktops throughout a company. Clients can also be mobile devices like laptops, tablets, and smartphones.
2. The **network** is the cabling, communication lines, network interface cards, hubs, routers, and other components that connect the clients and the server.
3. The **server**, commonly referred to as a **database server**, is a computer has enough processor speed, internal memory (RAM), and disk storage to store the files and databases of the system and provide services to the clients of the system. 
### Client/Server System Implementation
1. This computer can be a high-powered PC, a midrange system like an IBM Power System, or even a mainframe systems, often spread throughout the country or world, it is commonly refereed to as an **enterprise system**.
2. To back up the files of a client/server system, a server usually has a backup disk drive or some other form of offline storage. It often has one or more printers or specialized devices that can be shared by the users of the system. And it can provide programs or services like e-mail that can be accessed by all the users of the system. 
3. In a simple client/server system, the clients and the server are part of a **local area network** (LAN). However, two or more LANs that reside at separate geographical locations can be connected as part of a larger network such as a **wide area network** (WAN). In addition, individual systems or networks can be connected over the Internet.

# The Software Components of a Client/Server System
## Client software, Server Software, and the SQL interface
![[Pasted image 20220829220451.png]]
### Server Software
- A store and manage the databases of the client/server system, each server requires a **database management system (DBMS)** like MySQL
- The processing that's done by the DBMS is typically referred to as **back-end processing**, and the database server is referred to as the **back-end**
### Client Software
- The **application software** does the work that the user wants to do. This type of software can be purchased or developed
- The **data access API (application programming interface)** provides the interface between the application program and the DBMS. For example, for Java applications, the most common data access API for MySQL is **JDBS (Java Database Connectivity)**
- The processing that's done by the client software is typically referred to as **front-end processing**, and the client is typically referred to as the **front-end**
### The SQL Interface
- The application software communicates with DBMS by sending SQL queries through the data access API. When the DBMS receives a query, it provides a service like returning the requested data (the query results) to the client.
- **SQL** stands for **Structured Query Language**, which is the standard language for working with a relational database
### Client/Server Versus File-Handling Systems
- In a client/server system, the processing done by an application is typically divided between the client and the server.
- In a file-handling system, all of the processing is done on the clients. Although the clients may access data that's stored in files on the server, none of the processing is done by the server. As a result, a file-handling system isn't a client/server system.

## Other Client/Server Architectures
- In its simplest form, a client/server system consists of a single database server and one or more clients. Many client/server systems today, though, include additional servers. For example, figure 1-3 shows two client/server systems that include an additional server between the clients and the database server. 
- The first illustration is for a simple networked system. With this system, only the user interface for an application runs on the client. The rest of the processing that's done by the application is stored in one or more business components on the application server. Then, the client sends requests to the application server for processing. If the request involves accessing data in a database, the application server formulates the appropriate query and passes it on to the database server. The results of the query are then sent back to the application server, which processes the results and sends the appropriate respon.se back to the client.
- Similar processing is done by a web-based system, as illustrated by the second example in this figure. In this case, though, a web browser running on the client is used to send requests to a web application running on a web server somewhere on the Internet. The web application, in turn, can use web services to perform some of its processing. Then, the web application or web service can pass requests for data on to the database server. 
- Although this figure shot1ld give you an idea of how client/server systems can be configured, you should realize that they can be much more complicated than what's shown here. For example, business components can be distributed over any number of application servers, and those components can communicate with databases on any number of database servers. Similarly, the web applications and services in a web-based system can be distributed over numerous web servers that access numerous database servers. In most cases, though, you don' t need to know how a system is configured to use SQL. 
- Before I go on, you should know that client/server systems aren't the only systems that support SQL. For example, traditional mainframe systems and newer thin client systems also use SQL. Unlike client/server systems, though, most of the processing for these types of systems is done by a mainframe or another high-powered machine. The terminals or PCs that are connected to the system do little or no work.

### Description
- In addition to a database server and clients, a client/server system can include additional servers, such as **application servers** and **web servers**.
- Application servers are typically used to store **business components** that do part of the processing of the application. In particular, these components are used to process database requests from the user interface running on the client.
- Web servers are typically used to store **web applications** and **web services**. Web applications are applications that are designed to run on a web server. Web services are like business components, except that, like web applications, they are designed to run on a web server.
- In a web-based system, a **web browser** running on a client sends a request to a web server over the Internet. Then, the web server processes the request and passes any requests for data on to the database server.
- More complex system architectures can include two or more application servers, web servers, and database servers.

# An Introduction to the Relational Database Model
## How a Table is Organized
- The model for a relational database states that data is stored in one or more tables. It also states that each table can be viewed as a two-dimensional matrix consisting of rows and columns. This is illustrated by the relational table in figure 1-4. Each row in this table contains information about a single vendor. 
- In practice, the rows and columns of a relational database table are often referred to by the more traditional terms, records and fields. In fact, some software packages use one set of terms, some use the other, and some use a combination. In this book, I use the terms rows and columns because those are the terms used by MySQL. 
- In general, each table is modeled after a real-world entity such as a vendor or an invoice. Then, the columns of the table represent the attributes of the entity such as name, address, and phone number. And each row of the table represents one instance of the entity. A value is stored at the intersection of each row and colu1nn, sometimes called a cell. 
- If a table contains one or more columns that uniquely identify each row in the table, you can define these columns as the primary key of the table. For instance, the primary key of the Vendors table in this figure is the vendor_id column. In this example, the primary key consists of a single column. However, a primary key can also consist of two or more columns, in which case it's called a composite primary key. 
- In addition to primary keys, some database management systems let you define additional keys that uniquely identify each row in a table. If, for example, the vendor_name column in the Vendors table contains unique data, it can be defined as a non-primary key. In MySQL, this is called a unique key.
- **Indexes** provide an efficient way of accessing the rows in a table based on the values in one or more columns. Because applications typically access the rows in a table by referring to their key values, an index is automatically created for each key you define. However, you can define indexes for other columns as well. If, for example, you frequently need to sort the Vendor rows by zip code, you can set t1p an index for that column. Like a key, an index can include one or more columns.

#### Concepts
1. A relational database consists of tables. Tables consist of rows and columns, which can also be referred to as records and fields. 
2. A table is typically modeled after a real-world entity, such as an invoice or a vendor.
3. A column represents some attribute of the entity, such as the amount of an invoice or a vendor's address. 
4. A row contains a set of values for a single instance of the entity, such as one invoice or one vendor. 
5. The intersection of a row and a column is so1netimes called a cell. A cell stores a single value. 
6. Most tables have a primary key that uniquely identifies each row in the table. The primary key is usually a single column, but it can also consist of two or more columns. If a primary key uses two or more columns, it's called a composite primary key. 
7. In addition to primary keys, some database management systems let you define one or more non-primary keys. In MySQL, these keys are called unique keys. Like a primary key, a non-primary key uniquely identifies each row in the table. 
8. A table can also be defined with one or more indexes. An index provides an efficient way to access data from a table based on the values in specific columns. An index is automatically created for a table's primary and non-primary keys.

## How Tables are Related
- The tables in a database can be related to other tables by values in specific columns. The two tables shown in figure 1-5 illustrate this concept. Here, each row in the Vendors table is related to one or more rows in the Invoices table. This is called a **one-to-many relationship**. 
- Typically, relationships exist between the primary key in one table and the foreign key in another table. The **foreign key** is simply one or more columns in a table that refer to a primary key in another table. In this figure, for example, the vendor_id column is the foreign key in the Invoices table and is used to create the relationship between the Vendors table and the Invoices table. 
- Although one-to-many relationships are the most common, two tables can also have a one-to-one or many-to-many relationship. If a table has a **one-to-one relationship** with another table, the data in the two tables could be stored in a single table. Because of that, one-to-one relationships are used infrequently. 
- In contrast, a **many-to-many relationship** is usually implemented by using an intermediate table that has a one-to-many relationship with the two tables in the many-to-many relationship. In other words, a many-to-many relationship can usually be broken down into two one-to-many relationships.
- If you define a foreign key for a table in MySQL, you can have the foreign key enforce **referential integrity**. When MySQL enforces referential integrity, it makes sure that any changes to the data in the database don't create invalid relationships between tables. For example, if you try to add a row to the Invoices table with a vendor_id value that doesn't exist in the Vendors table, MySQL won't add the row and will display an error. This helps to maintain the integrity of the data that's stored in the database.

### The Relationship Between the Vendors and Invoices tables in the Database
![[Pasted image 20220829223032.png]]
#### Concepts
- The vendor_id column is the Invoices table is called a **foreign key** because it identifies a related row in the Vendors table. A table may contain one or more foreign keys.
- When you define a foreign key for a table in MySQL, you can have the foreign key enforce **referential integrity**. Then, MySQL makes sure that any changes to the data in the database don't create invalid relationships between tables.
- The most common type of relationship is a **one-to-many relationship** as illustrated by the Vendors and Invoices tables. A table can also have a **one-to-one relationship** or a **many-to-many relationship** with another table

## How Columns are Defined
- When you define a column in a table, you assign properties to it as indicated by the design of the Invoices table in figure 1-6. The most critical property for a column is its data type, which determines the type of information that can be stored in the column. With MySQL, you can choose from the **data types** listed in this figure as well as several other data types that are described in chapter 8. As you define each column in a table, you generally try to assign the data type that minimizes the use of disk storage because that improves the performance of the queries later. 
- In addition to a data type, you must identify whether the column can store a **null value** (or just null). A null represents a value that's unknown, unavailable, or not applicable. In this figure, the columns that have the NN (not null) box checked don't allow null values. If you don't allow null values for a column, you must provide a value for that column when you store a new row in the table. 
- You can also assign a **default value** to each column. Then, that value is assigned to the column if another value isn't provided. As you can see, three of the columns of the Invoices table have a default value. You'll learn more about how to work with null and defa1tlt values later in this book.
- Each table can also contain a numeric column whose value is generated automatically by the DBMS. In MySQL, a column like this is called an **auto increment column**. You'll learn more about defining auto increment columns in chapter 11. For now, just note that the primary key of both the Vendors and Invoices tables-vendor_id and invoice_id-are auto increment columns.

### Common MySQL Datatypes
![[Pasted image 20220829230029.png]]
#### Description
- The data type that's assigned to a column determines the type of information that can be stored in the column.
- Each column definition also indicates whether or not it can contain null values. A null value indicates that the value of the column is unknown.
- A column can also be defined with a def a ult value. Then, that value is used if another value isn't provided when a row is added to the table.
- A column can also be defined as an auto increment column. An auto increment column is a numeric column whose value is generated automatically when a row is added to the table.
## How to read a Database Diagram
- When working with relational databases, you can use an **entity-relationship (ER) diagram** to show how the tables in a database are defined and related. Or, you can use a newer version of an ER diagram known as an enhanced entity-relationship (EER) diagram. In figure 1-7, for example, you can see an EER diagram for the AP (Accounts Payable) database that's used throughout this book. This diagram shows that the database contains five related tables: Vendors, Terms, Invoices, Invoice_Line_Items, and General_Ledger_Accounts. 
- For each table, this diagram shows how the columns are defined. For example, it shows that the Vendors table has 12 columns. It shows the name and data type for each column. It uses a key icon to show that the primary key for this table is the vendor id column. And it uses a dark diamond icon to show that the table has two columns that are foreign keys: default_terms_id and default account number.
- This diagram also shows how the tables are related. To do that, it places a connector symbol between the tables. For example, the connector between the Vendors and Invoices table shows that these tables have a one-to-many relationship. On this connector, the symbol closest to the Invoices table indicates that many invoices can exist for each vendor, and the symbol closest to the Vendors table shows that only one vendor can exist for each invoice. If you study the primary and foreign keys for these tables, you can deduce that these tables are designed to be joined on the vendor_id column that's in both tables. 
- Similarly, this diagram shows that there's a one-to-many relationship between the Terms and Vendors table. In other words, each terms of payment can have many vendors, but each vendor can only have one default ter1ns of payment. If you study the primary and foreign keys for these tables, you can deduce that these tables are designed to be joined on the terms_id column of the Terms table and the default terms id column of the Vendors table.
- Most of the tables in this diagram begin with a single column that defines the primary key for the table. However, the Invoice_Line_ltems table begins with two columns (invoice_id and invoice_sequence) that define the primary key for this table. In other words, since the invoice_id column doesn't uniquely identify the line item, the primary key must include the invoice_sequence column so it can uniquely identify each row. 
- In chapter 10, you'll learn how to use MySQL Workbench to create and work with EER diagrams. For now, you just need to understand how to read the diagram presented in this figure so you can understand the relationships between the tables in the AP database.
