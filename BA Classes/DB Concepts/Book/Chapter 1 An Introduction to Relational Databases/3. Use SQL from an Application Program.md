## Common options for accessing MySQL data
- Figure 1-16 shows three ways to access a MySQL database when you use a programming language to write a custom application. The technique that's used varies depending on the language that's used to develop the application. However, most modem languages provide an API that allows you to connect to a MySQL database. 
- An API uses a piece of software known as a **database driver** to communicate with the database. For some languages, the database driver is built in. For others, you need to download and install a database driver. 
- To access a MySQL database from a PHP application, for example, you typically choose from two APIs. Some programmers prefer to use the **mysqli** (MySQL Improved Extensions) API. Other programmers prefer to use the newer PDO (PHP Data Objects) API. Neither of these APIs requires a database driver, since that driver is typically included as part of the PHP language. 
- On the other hand, to access a MySQL database from a Java application, you typically use the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API. This API requires a driver to communicate with MySQL. In most cases, you can use the Connector/J driver that's available from the MySQL website to connect a Java application to a MySQL database. 
- Although it's more common to use MySQL with non-Microsoft languages such as PHP and Java, it's possible to use MySQL with Microsoft .NET languages such as C# and Visual Basic. However, the .NET platform doesn't include a database driver by default, so you typically need to download and install the Connector/Net driver that's available from the MySQL website. Then, you can use the ADO.NET API to access a MySQL database.

### Two commonly used MySQL drivers
1. Connector/J
	1. Connects Java applications to a MySQL database
2. Connector/NET
	1. Connects .NET applications to a MySQL database

### Description
- To work with a MySQL database, an application uses a data access API. For example, PHP uses the mysqli API or the PDO API, Java uses the JDBC API, and .NET languages like C# and Visual Basic use the ADO.NET API.
- Most modem programming languages provide an API that you can use to access MySQL. 
- Some programming languages include a piece of software known as a database driver for the API that it uses to access MySQL. For example, PHP includes a MySQL driver for both the mysqli and PDQ APIs. As a result, you typically don't need to install a database driver when you use PHP. 
- Some programming languages don't provide a database driver to communicate with a MySQL database. For example, Java doesn't include a MySQL driver for the JDBC API. As a result, you typically need to install a database driver such as the Connector/J driver before you can use Java to access MySQL.

## PHP Code that Retrieves Data from MySQL
- Figure 1-17 presents PHP code that t1ses the PDO API to execute a SQL statement against a MySQL database. This code displays information from the Vendors and Invoices tables. It creates the PDO objects used by the application and then uses them to display the data that's retrieved. 
- If you have some PHP programming experience, you shouldn't have much trouble understanding this code. If you don't have PHP experience, that's fine too. In that case, focus on how this code uses the PDQ API to execute SQL against a MySQL database. If you want to learn more about using PHP to work with a database, we recommend Mitrach's PHP and MySQL. 
- The code in this figure begins by defining a PHP script. Within this script, the first statement stores a SELECT statement in a variable named $query. Then, the next three statements create variables that store the information that's needed to connect to a MySQL database named AP that's running on the same computer as the PHP application. That includes variables that specify a username of ''ap_tester'' and a password of ''sesame''. 
- Here, the same script that created the database also created the ap_tester. This user has limited privileges. In particular, it can only access the AP database, not other databases. In addition, it can only work with the data in the database, not modify the structure of the database. As a result, when writing code, it's 1nore secure to connect to the database as the ap_tester than to connect as a global user such as the root user that has all privileges on all databases. 
- After specifying the connection information, this code uses these variables to create a PDO object that represents a connection to the database. If this code isn't able to create a PDQ object, an error known as a PDOException occurs, and the application displays an error message and ends. Otherwise, this code uses the PDQ object to prepare the SELECT statement. Then, it executes that statement, gets all rows from the result set, and stores them in a variable named $rows. 
- At this point, the HTML tags begin displaying an HTML page. Within the < body > tag, a PHP script loops through each row in the result set and displays that data on the HTML page. In particular, it displays the vendor_name, invoice_number, and invoice_total columns. Here, the PHP function named number_format is used to apply formatting to the invoice_total column. 
- Although this code may seem complicated, there's only one statement in this figure that uses SQL. That's the statement that specifies the SELECT statement to be executed. Of course, if an application updates data, it can execute INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements as well. With the skills that you'll learn in this book, though, you won't have any trouble coding the SQL statements you need.

## Note
- For this code to run correctly with MySQL 8.0 or later you must be using a recent version of PHP that includes a PDO driver that supports MySQL 8.0's new default authentication plug-in (caching_sha2_password), or you must use MySQL's older authentication plug_in (mysql_native_password)

# Java Code that Retrieves Data from MySQL
- Figure 1-18 presents Java code that uses the JDBC API to execute a SQL statement against a MySQL database. This code displays information from the Vendors and Invoices tables. If you have some Java programming experience, you shouldn't have much trouble understanding this code. If you don't have Java experience, that's fine too. In that case, focus on how this code uses an API to execute SQL against a MySQL database. 
- If you want to learn more about using Java to work with a database, we recommend Murach's Java Programming and Murach's Java Servlets and JSP. 
- Before this code can be executed, a database driver must be installed. To do that, you can download the Connector/I database driver from the MySQL website. Then, you can add the JAR file for that driver to the libraries that are available to your application. 
- The code in this figure begins by importing all classes in the java.sql package. These classes define JDBC objects like the Connection object that are used to access a MySQL database. 
- Within the main method, the first statement stores a SQL SELECT statement in a variable named query. Then, the next three statements create variables that store the information that's needed to connect to a MySQL database named AP that's running on the same computer as the Java application on port 3306. That includes variables that specify a username of ''ap_tester'' and a password of ''sesame''. Like the previous figure, the code in this figure connects as the ap_tester instead of the root user for secu1Â·ity reasons. For more information about the ap_tester, please refer to the previous figure. 
- After specifying the connection information, this code uses a try-with-resources statement to create the Connection, PreparedStatement, and ResultSet objects that are needed to display the data. Since the try-withresources statement was introduced with Java SE 7, it won't work with earlier versions of Java. If this statement isn't able to create these objects, an error known as a SQLException occurs, and the application prints an error message and ends. Otherwise, this code uses the Connection and PreparedStatement objects to execute the SELECT statement, and it stores the result set in a ResultSet object. 
- Next, this code uses the get methods of the ResultSet object to retrieve the values that are stored in the vendor_name, invoice_number, and invoice_total columns. Here, the getString method is used to get the VARCHAR data and the getDouble 1nethod is used to get tl1e DECIMAL data. Finally, the NumberFormat class is used to apply currency formatting to the invoice_total column, and the values are printed to the console.
