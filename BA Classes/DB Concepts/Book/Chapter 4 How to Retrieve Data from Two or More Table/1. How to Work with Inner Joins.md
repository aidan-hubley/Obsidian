# How to Work with Inner Joins
A join lets you combine columns from two or more tables into a single result set. To start, this chapter shows how to code the most common type of join, an  inner Join. 
## How to code an inner join
- Figure 4-1 shows how to use the explicit syntax to code an inner join. This syntax is also called the SQL-92 syntax because it was introduced by the SQL-92 standards. It's generally considered a best practice to use this syntax. 
- To join data from two tables, you code the names of the two tables in the FROM clause along with the JOIN keyword and an ON phrase that specifies the join condition. The join condition indicates how the two tables should be compared. In most cases, they're compared based on the relationship between the primary key of the first table and a foreign key of the second table. 
- In this figure, for example, the SELECT statement joins data from the Vendors and Invoices tables based on the vendor_id column in each table. Since the join condition uses the equal operator, the value of the vendor_id column in a row in the Vendors table must match the vendor_id in a row in the Invoices table for that row to be included in the result set. In other words, only vendors with one or more invoices are included. Although you code most inner joins using the equal operator, you can compare two tables based on other conditions too. For example, you can use the greater than or less than operators for an inner join condition. 
- In this figure, the Vendors table is joined with the Invoices table using a column that has the same name in both tables: vendor_id. As a result, the columns must be qualified so MySQL can tell which table they come from. To code a qualified column name, you can enter the table name and a pe1iod in front of the column name. In this figure, the SELECT statement only uses qualified column names in the join condition. However, you must qualify a column name anywhere it appears in the statement if the same name occurs in both tables. If you don't, MySQL returns an error indicating that the column name is ambiguous.

### Description 
- A join combines columns from two or more tables into a result set based on the join conditions you specify. For an inner join, only those rows that satisfy the join condition are included in the result set. 
- A join condition names a column in each of the two tables involved in the join and indicates how the two columns should be compared. In most cases, you use the equal operator to retrieve rows with matching columns. However, you can also use any of the other comparison operators in a join condition. 
- Tables are typically joined on the relationship between the primary key in one table and a foreign key in the other table. However, you can also join tables based on relationships not defined in the database. These are called ad hoc relationships.
- If the two columns in a join condition have the same name, you must qualify them with the table name so MySQL can distinguish between them. To code a qualified column name, type the table name, followed by a period, followed by the column name. 
### Note 
- The INNER keyword is optional and is seldom used.
## How to use table aliases
- When you name a table to be joined in the FROM clause, you can refer to the table by an alias as shown in figure 4-2. A table alias is an alternative table name that's typically just a letter or two. This makes it easier to qualify the column names in the rest of the statement, and it makes the query easier to code and read, especially when the table names are long. 
- The first example in this figure joins data from the Vendors and Invoices tables. Here, both tables have been assigned aliases that consist of a single letter. 
- The second example only assigns an alias to the second table, not the first. Here, the alias shortens the name of the Invoice_Line_Items table to just Line_ltems. As a result, the shorter name can be used to refer to the invoice_id column of the table in the join condition. Although you can use this technique when you code a query, most programmers use abbreviations of the table names as shown in the first example and throughout the rest of this chapter. 
- After you assign a table alias, you must use the alias in ,place of the original table name throughout the query. Otherwise, MySQL returns an error message instead of a result set.

### Description
- A table alias is an alternative table name assigned in the FROM clause. You can use an alias, which is typically just a letter or two, to make a SQL statement easier to code and read. 
- If you assign an alias to a table, you must use that alias to refer to the table throughout your query. You can't use the original table name. 
- You can use an alias for one table in a join without using an alias for another table.

## How to join to a table in another database
- If you use the procedure described in appendix A (Windows) or appendix B (macOS) of this book to create the databases for this book, all of the tables are organized into three databases, which are also known as schemas. First, all tables pertaining to accounts payable such as the Vendors and Invoices tables are stored in the database, or schema, named AP. Then, all tables pertaining to order management are stored in a database named OM. Finally, all tables that are used by the smaller examples presented in this book are stored in a database named EX. 
- When you use MySQL Workbench to run a query against a database, you don't need to qualify any table name with its database name. For example, when you run a query against the AP database, you don't need to qualify the Vendors table with the name of the database. 
- However, you may occasionally need to join to a table that's in another database. To do that, you must qualify the table name in the other database by prefixing the table name with the database name. For example, let's say you need to join the Vendors table in the AP database with the Customers table in the OM database. To do that, you need to qualify the Customers table with the name of the database as shown in figure 4-3.
### The syntax of a table name that's qualified with a database name

### Description
- A MySQL server can store tables in multiple databases. These databases are sometimes refe1Ted to as schemas. 
- When you run a SELECT statement against one database, you can join to a table in another database if you have appropriate privileges. To do that, you must prefix the table name in the other database with the name of that database.

## How to use compound join condition
- Although a join condition typically consists of a single comparison, you can include two or more co1nparisons in a join condition using the AND and OR operators. Figure 4-4 shows how this works. 
- The query in this figure uses the AND operator to return the first and last names of all customers in the Customers table whose first and last names also exist in the Employees table. Since Thomas Hardy is the only name that exists in both tables, this is the only row that's returned in the result set for this query.

### Description
- A join condition can include two or more conditions connected by AND or OR operators

## How to use a self-join
- A self-join. joins a table to itself. Although self-joins are rare, they are sometimes useful for retrieving data that can't be retrieved any other way. For example, figure 4-5 presents a self-join that returns rows from the Vendors table where the vendor is in a city and state that has at least one other vendor. In other words, it does not return a vendor if that vendor is the only vendor in that city and state. 
- Since this example uses the same table twice, it must use aliases to distinguish one occurrence of the table from the other. In addition, this query must qualify each column name with a table alias since every column occurs in both tables. 
- Then, the join condition uses three comparisons. The first two match the vendor_city and vendor_state columns in the two tables. As a result, the query returns rows for vendors that are in the same city and state as another vendor. However, since a vendor resides in the same city and state as itself, a third comparison is included to exclude rows that match a vendor with itself. To do that, this condition uses the not-equal operator to compare the vendor_name columns in the two tables. 
- In addition, this statement includes the DISTINCT keyword. That way, a vendor appears only once in the result set. Otherwise, a vendor would appear once for every other row with a matching city and state. For example, if a vendor is in a city and state that has nine other vendors in that city and state, this query would return nine rows for that vendor. 
- This example also shows how you can use columns other than key columns in a join condition. Keep in mind, however, that this is an unusual situation and you 're not likely to code joins like this often.
### A self-join that returns vendors from cities in common with other vendors
![[Pasted image 20220912233121.png]]
### Description
- A self-join is a join that joins a table with itself
- When you code a self-join, you must use aliases for the tables, and you must qualify each column name with the aliases for the tables, and you must qualify each column with the alias

## How to join more than two tables
- So far, this chapter has only showed how to join data from two tables. However, it's common for programmers to need to join data from more than two tables. For example, it's not unheard of to need to join 10 or more tables. Fortunately, once you code the join condition correctly, you can often reuse it. 
- The SELECT statement in figure 4-6 joins data from four tables: Vendors, Invoices, Invoice_Line_Items, and General_Ledger_Accounts. Each of the joins is based on the relationship between the primary key of one table and a foreign key of the other table. For example, the account_number column is the primary key of the General_Ledger_Accounts table and a foreign key of the Invoice Line Items table. 
- This SELECT statement also begins to show how table aliases make a statement easier to code and read. Here, the one-letter and two-letter aliases that are used for the tables allow you to code the ON clause more concisely.
### A statement that joins four tables

### Description
- You can think of a multi-table join as a series of two-table joins proceeding from left to right 

## How to use the implicit inner join syntax
- Although it's generally considered a best practice to use the explicit inner join syntax described earlier in this chapter, MySQL also provides the implicit inner join syntax shown in figure 4-7. This syntax was widely used prior to the introduction of the explicit syntax. You should be familiar with the older implicit syntax mainly because you may need to maintain existing SQL statements that use it. 
- When you use the implicit syntax for an inner join, you code the tables in the FROM clause separated by commas. Then, you code the join conditions in the WHERE clause. 
- The first SELECT statement joins data from the Vendors and Invoices tables. Like the SELECT statement shown in figure 4-1, this statement joins these tables on an equal comparison between the vendor_id columns in the two tables. In this case, though, the comparison is coded as the search condition of the WHERE clause. However, both of these statements return the same result set. 
- The second SELECT statement uses the implicit syntax to join data from four tables. This is the same join you saw in figure 4-6. In this example, the three join conditions are combined in the WHERE clause using the AND operator. In addition, an AND operator is used to combine the join conditions with the search condition. 
- Because the explicit syntax for joins lets you separate join conditions from search conditions, statements that use the explicit syntax are typically easier to read than those that use the implicit syntax. In addition, the explicit syntax helps you avoid a common coding mistake with the implicit syntax: omitting the join condition. As you'll learn later in this chapter, an implicit join without a join condition results in a cross join, which can return a large number of rows. For these reasons, we recommend that you use the explicit syntax in all your new SQL code.

### Description
- Instead of coding a join condition in the FROM clause, you can code it in the WHERE clause along with any search conditions. In that case, you list the tables in the FROM clause separated by commas. 
- This syntax for coding joins is referred to as the implicit syntax. It was used prior to the SQL-92 standards, which introduced the explicit syntax.
