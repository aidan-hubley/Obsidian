# How to Update Existing Rows
To modify the data in one or 1nore rows of a table, you use the UPDATE statement. Although most of the UPDATE statements you code will perform simple updates, you can also code more complex UPDATE statements that include subqueries if necessary.
## How to update rows
- Figure 5-5 presents the syntax of the UPDATE statement. Most UPDATE statements include all three of the clauses shown here. The UPDATE clause names the table to be updated. The SET clause names the columns to be updated and the values to be assigned to those columns. And the WHERE clause specifies the condition a row must meet to be updated. 
- When you use MySQL Workbench, you should realize that it will execute an UPDATE statement only if the condition on the WHERE clause refers to a primary or foreign key. That's because, by default, Workbench runs in ''safe update'' mode. If that's not what you want, you can turn safe update mode off as described in this figure. For example, because the WHERE clause in the first and third UPDATE statements in this figure refer to the invoice_number column, which isn't a key column, you have to turn safe mode off to execute them. 
- The first UPDATE statement modifies the values of two columns in the Invoices table: payment_date and payment_total. Since the WHERE clause in this statement identifies a single row, MySQL only updates the columns in that row. In this example, the values for the columns are coded as a literal values. You should realize, though, that you can assign any valid expression to a column as long as it evaluates to a value that's compatible with the data type of the column. You can also use the NULL keyword to assign a null value to a column that allows nulls, and you can use the DEFAULT keyword to assign the default value to a column that's defined with a default value. 
- The second UPDATE statement modifies a single column in the Invoices table: terms_id. This time, however, the WHERE clause specifies that all the rows for vendor 95 should be updated. Since this vendor has six rows in the Invoices table, MySQL updates all six rows.
- The third UPDATE statement shows how you can use an expression to assign a value to a column. In this case, the expression increases the value of the credit_total column by 100. Like the first UPDATE statement, this statement updates a single row. 
- Before you execute an UPDATE statement, you may want to make sure that you've selected the correct rows. To do that, you can code a SELECT statement with the same search condition. Then, if the SELECT statement returns the correct rows, you can copy its WHERE clause into your UPDATE statement

### Description
- You use the UPDATE statement to modify one or more rows in a table. 
- In the SET clause, you name each column and its new value. You can specify the value for a column as a literal or an expression. 
- In the WHERE clause, you can specify the conditions that must be met for a row to be updated. 
- You can use the DEFAULT and NULL keywords to specify default and null values as described in figure 5-3. 
- By default, MySQL Workbench runs in safe update mode. That prevents you from updating rows if the WHERE clause is omitted or doesn't refer to a primary key or foreign key column. 
- To get around the restrictions of safe update mode, you can turn this mode off. To do that, select the Preferences command, select the SQL Editor node, change the ''Safe Updates'' option, and restart MySQL Workbench.
### Warning
- If you turn off safe update mode and omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be updated.

## How to use a subquery in an UPDATE statement
- When you code the search condition on the WHERE clause of an UPDATE statement, you can include a subquery to identify the rows to be updated. Figure 5-6 presents two statements that ill11strate how you do that. 
- In the frrst statement, a subquery is used in the WHERE clause to identify the invoices to be updated. This subquery returns the vendor_id value for the vendor in the Vendors table with the name ''Pacific Bell." Then, all the invoices with that vendor_id value are updated. 
- The second UPDATE statement also uses a subquery in the WHERE clause. This subquery returns a list of the vendor_id values for all vendors in California, Arizona, and Nevada. Then, the IN operator is used to update all the invoices with vendor_id values in that list. Although this subquery returns 80 vendors, many of these vendors don' t have invoices. As a result, the UPDATE statement only affects 40 invoices. 
- To execute the second UPDATE statement from MySQL Workbench, you have to turn safe update mode off. That's because the WHERE clause in this statement uses the IN operator.

### Description
- You can code a subquery in the WHERE clause of an UPDATE statement to provide one 01Â· more values used in the search condition.
