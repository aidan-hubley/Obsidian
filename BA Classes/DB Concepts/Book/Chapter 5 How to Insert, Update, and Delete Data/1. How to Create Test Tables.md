# How to create test tables
Before you begin experimenting with INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE
statements, you need to make sure that your experimentation won't affect ''live''
data that's used by other people at your business or school.
## How to create the tables for this book
- If you 're only working with the tables for this book, you can use the procedure shown in appendix A (Windows) or B (1nacOS) to create the tables for this book. Then, you can experiment all you want without worrying about how much you change these tables. If yot1 ever want to restore these tables to their original state, you can use the procedure shown in the appendix to do that.
## How to create a copy of a table
- If you're working with tables that are running on a server that's available from your business or school, it's usually a good idea to create a copy of some or all of a table before you do any testing. To do that, you can use the CREATE TABLE AS statement with a SELECT statement as shown in figure 5-1 . When you use this technique, the result set that's defmed by the SELECT statement is copied into a new table. Then, you can experiment all you want with the test table and delete it when you 're done.
- When you use this technique to create tables, MySQL only copies the column definitions and data. In other words, MySQL doesn't retain other parts of the column definitions such as primary keys, foreign keys, and indexes. As a result, when you experiment with copied tables, you may get different results than you would get with the original tables. Still, this is usually preferable to experimenting with live data.
- The examples in this figure show how to use the CREATE TABLE AS statement. Here, the first example copies all of the columns from all of the rows in the Invoices table into a new table named Invoices_ Copy. The second example copies all of the columns in the Invoices table into a new table named Old_lnvoices, but only for rows where the balance due is zero. And the third example creates a table that contains summary data from the Invoices table.
- When you're done experimenting with test tables, you can use the DROP TABLE statement that's shown in this figure to delete any tables you don't need anymore. In this figure, for instance, the fourth example shows how to drop the Old_Invoices table.
### The syntax of the Create Table AS statement
- CREATE TABLE table_name AS select_statement
### Create a complete copy of the Invoices table
- CREATE TABLE invoice_copy AS
- SELECT * 
- FROM invoice
### Create a partial copy of the Invoices table
- CREATE TABLE old_invoices AS
- SELECT *
- FROM invoices
- WHERE inoice_total - payment - credit_total = 0
### CREATE a table with summary rows from the Invoices table

### Delete a table
- DROP TABLE old_invoices
### Description
- You can use the CREATE TABLE AS statement to create a new table based on the result set defined by a SELECT state1nent. 
- Each column name in the SELECT clause must be unique. If you use calculated values in the select list, you must name the column. 
- You can code the other clauses of the SELECT statement just as you would for any other SELECT statement, including grouping, aggregates, joins, and subqueries. 
- If you code the CREATE TABLE AS statement as shown above, the table you name must not exist. If it does, you must delete the table by using the DROP TABLE statement before you execute the CREATE TABLE AS statement. 
- When you use the CREATE TABLE AS state1nent to create a table, only the column definitions and data are copied. Definitions of primary keys, foreign keys, indexes, and so on are not included in the new table.

## How to Insert new rows
- To add rows to a table, you use the INSERT statement. In most cases, you use this statement to add a single row to a table. However, you can also use it to add multiple rows to a table.
## How to insert a single row
- Figure 5-2 starts by showing how to code INSERT statements that insert a single row. Because the examples in this figure insert rows into the Invoices table, this figure reviews the column definitions for this table. This shows the sequence of the columns in the table and which columns have default values or allow null values. It also shows that invoice_id is an auto increment column. When you code an INSERT statement, you name the table on the INSERT clause, followed by an optional list of columns. Then, you list the values to be inserted on the VALUES clause. 
- The first two examples in this figure illustrate how this works. The first example doesn't include a column list. Because of that, the VALUES clause must include a value for every column in the table, and those values must be listed in the same sequence that the columns appear in the table. That way, MySQL knows which value to assign to which column. Notice that this statement uses the NULL keyword to assign a null value to the payment_date column. You'll learn more about using this keyword in the next figure. 
- The second INSERT statement includes a column list. However, this list doesn't include four columns. It doesn't include the invoice id column since MySQL automatically increments this column if a value isn't specified. It doesn't include the payment_total and credit_total columns since these columns provide a default value of 0. And it doesn't include the payment_date column since this column allows a null value. In addition, the columns aren't listed in the same sequence as the columns in the table. When you include a list of columns, you can code the columns in any sequence you like. Then, you just need to be sure you code the values in the VALUES clause in the same sequence. 
- When you specify the values for the columns to be inserted, you must be sure that those values are compatible with the data types of the columns. For example, you must enclose literal values for dates and strings within quotes. However, the quotes are optional when you code literal values for numbers. You'll learn more about working with data types in chapter 8. For now, just realize that if any of the values aren't compatible with the corresponding column data types, MySQL returns an error and the row isn't inserted.
## How to insert multiple rows
- The third example in figure 5-2 shows how to insert multiple rows. When you do that, yot1 follow the same rules as you do for inserting a single row. Then, you separate each list of values with a comma. This technique is often useful when you need to create a script that inserts data into a database.

### Insert multiple rows
![[Pasted image 20220915170632.png]]
### Description
- You use the INSERT statement to add one or more rows to a table. 
- In the INSERT clause, you specify the name of the table that you want to add a row to, along with an optional column list. The INTO keyword is also optional. 
- In the VALUES clause, you specify the values to be inserted. If you don't include a column list in the INSERT clause, you must specify the column values in the same order as in the table, and you must code a value for each column. If you include a column list, you must specify the column values in the same order as in the column list, and you can omit columns that have default values, accept null values, or are automatically generated. 
- To insert a null value into a column, you can use the NULL keyword. To insert a default value or to have MySQL generate a value for an auto increment column, you can use the DEFAULT keyword. For more information, see figure 5-3.

## How to insert default values and null values
- If a column allows null values, you can use the INSERT statement to insert a null value into that column. Si1nilarly, if a column is defined with a default value, you can use the INSERT statement to inse1t that value. Finally, if a column is defined as an auto increment column, you can have MySQL generate a value for the column. The technique you use depends on whether the INSERT statement includes a column list, as shown by the examples in figure 5-3. 
- All of these INSERT statements use a table named Color_Sample from the EX database. This table contains the three columns shown at the top of this figure. The first column, color_id, is defined so MySQL automatically generates its value whenever necessary. The second column, color_number, is defined with a default value of 0. And the third column, color_name, is defined so it allows null values. 
- The first two statements show how to assign an automatically incremented value, a default value, or a null value using a column list. To do that, you omit the column from the list. In the first statement, for example, the column list names only the color_number column. As a result, MySQL automatically assigns a value of 1 to the color_id column (assuming the table doesn't contain any rows) and a null value to the color_name column. Similarly, in the second statement, the column list na1nes only the color_name column. As a result, MySQL assigns a value of 2 to the color_id column and a value of O to the colo1Â· number column. 
- The next three statements show how to assign an automatically incremented, default, or null value to a column without including a column list. To do that, you can use the DEFAULT and NULL keywords. For example, the third statement specifies a value for the color_name column, but uses the DEFAULT keyword for the color_id and color_number columns. As a result, MySQL assigns an automatically incremented value of 3 to the color_id column and a default value of O to the color_number column. The fourth statement uses the NULL keyword to assign a null value to the color_name column. Finally, the fifth statement shows what happens if you use the DEFAULT keyword for the first two columns and the NULL keyword for the third column.

### Description
- If a column is defined so it allows null values, you can use the NULL keyword in the list of values to insert a null value into that column. 
- If a column is defined with a default value, you can use the DEFAULT keyword in the list of values to insert the default value for that column. 
- If a column is defined as an auto increment column, you can use the DEFAULT keyword in the list of values to have MySQL generate the value for the column. 
- If you include a column list, you can omit columns with default values and null values. Then, the default value or null value is assigned automatically. You can also omit an auto increment column. Then, MySQL generates the value for the column.

## How to use a subquery in an INSERT statement
- A subquery is just a SELECT statement that's coded within another SQL statement. Since you already know how to code SELECT statements, you shouldn't have much trouble coding subqueries as described in this chapter. Then, in chapter 7, you'll learn more about coding subqueries. Figure 5-4 shows how to code a subquery in an INSERT statement. Here, both examples use a SELECT statement instead of a VALUES clause. As a result, the subquery specifies the values for the new rows by selecting these values from another table. 
- Both examples retrieve rows from the Invoices table and insert them into a table named Invoice_Archive. This table is defined with the same columns as the Invoices table. However, the invoice_id column isn't defined as an auto increment column, and the payment_total and credit_total columns aren't defined with default values. As a result, you must include values for these columns. 
- The first example shows how you can use a subquery in an INSERT statement without a column list. In this example, the SELECT clause of the subquery uses an asterisk to retrieve all the columns in the Invoices table. Then, after MySQL applies the search condition in the WHERE clause, all the rows in the result set are inserted into the Invoice Archive table. 
- The second example shows how you can use a subquery in an INSERT statement with a column list. Just as when you use the VALUES clause, you can list the columns in any sequence. However, the columns must be listed in the same sequence in the SELECT clause of the subquery. In addition, you can omit auto increment columns, columns that are defined with default values, and columns that allow null values. 
- When you code a subquery in an INSERT statement, you don't code parentheses around the SELECT statement. That's because the SELECT statement is coded instead of the VALUES clause. However, when you code a subquery in the WHERE clause of an UPDATE or INSERT statement, you do code parentheses around the SELECT statement. Later in this chapter, you'll see some examples of this. 
- Before you execute an INSERT statement that uses a subquery, you should make sure that the rows and columns retrieved by the subquery are the ones you want to insert. To do that, you can execute the SELECT statement by itself. Then, when you're sure it retrieves the collect data, you can add the INSERT clause to insert the rows into another table.
### The syntax for using a subquery to insert one or more rows
- INSERT [INTO] table_name [(column_list)] select_statement
### Insert paid invoices into the Invoice_Archive table
![[Pasted image 20220915171323.png]]
### The same statement with a column list
![[Pasted image 20220915171342.png]]
### Description
- A subquery is a SELECT statement that's coded within another SQL statement. 
- To insert rows selected from one or more tables into another table, you can code a subquery in place of the VALUES clause. Then, MySQL inserts the rows returned by the subquery into the target table. For this to work, the target table must already exist.
- The rules for working with a column list are the same as they are for any INSERT statement.
