# How to work with complex queries
- So far, the examples you've seen of queries that use subqueries have been relatively simple. However, these types of queries can get complicated in a hurry, particularly if the subqueries are nested. Because of that, you'll want to be st1re that you plan and test these queries carefully. In a moment, you'll learn how to do that. But first, this chapter presents an example of a complex query.
## A complex query that uses subqueries
- Figure 7-11 presents a complex query that uses multiple subqueries. The first subquery is used in the FROM clause of the outer query to create a result set that contains the state, name, and total invoice amount for each vendor in the Vendors table. This is the same subquery that was described in figure 7-10. As a result, you should already understand how it works. 
- The second subquery is also used in the FROM clause of the outer query to create a result set that's joined with the first result set. This result set contains the state and total invoice amount for the vendor in each state that has the largest invoice total. To create this result set, a third subquery is nested within the FROM clause of the subquery. This subquery is identical to the first subquery. 
- After this statement creates the two result sets, it joins them based on the columns in each table that contain the state and the total invoice amount. The final result set includes the state, name, and total invoice amount for the vendor in each state with the largest invoice total. This result set is sorted by state. 
- At this point, you might be wondering if there is an easier solution to this problem. For example, you might think that you could solve the problem by joining the Vendors and Invoices tables, grouping by vendor state, and calculating the sum of invoices for each vendor. However, if you group by vendor state, you can't include the name of the vendor in the result set. And if you group by vendor state and vendor name, the result set includes all vendors, not just the top vendor from each state. As a result, the query presented here is a fairly straightforward way of solving the problem
- When you code a complex subqt1ery, it's often helpful to include comments. You can use comments to describe the different parts of the query without changing how the query operates. To code a single-line comment, you start the line with two dashes ( - - ) . 
- In this figure, the query includes three co1nments. The first comment identifies the first subquery, the second comment identifies the second subquery, and the third comment identifies the third subquery. These comments make it easier to read the main query by making it easier to identify the three subqueries and determine what they do. For example, these comments clearly show that the subqueries that have aliases of t1 and t2 return the same result set.

### Description
- This query retrieves the vendor from each state that has the largest invoice total. To do that, it uses three subqueries. 
- This query uses comments to clearly identify its three queries. 
- The subqueries named tl and t2 return the same result set. This result set includes the vendor state, name, and sum of invoices. 
- The subquery named t3 returns a result set that includes the vendor state and the largest sum of invoices for any vendor in that state. To do that, this subquery uses a nested subquery named t2. 
- The subqueries named tl and t3 are joined on both the vendor_state and st1m_of_invoices columns.

## A procedure for building complex queries
- To build a complex query like the one in the previous figure, you can use a procedure like the one in figure 7-12. To sta1t, you should state the question in English so you're clear about what you want the query to answer. In this case, the question is, ''Which vendor in each state has the largest invoice total?'' 
- Once you're clear about the problem, you can outline the query using pseudocode. Pseudocode is code that represents the intent of the query, but doesn't necessarily use SQL code. The pseudocode shown in this figure, for example, uses part SQL code and part English. This pseudocode identifies the three columns returned by the main query, two subqueries, and even the join condition for the two subqueries.
- The next step in the procedure is to code and test the subqueries to be sure they work the way you want them to. For example, this figure shows the code for the frrst subquery along with its result set. This returns all of the data that you want, but it also includes extra rows that you don't want. To remove the extra rows from the frrst query, you can code the second subquery shown in this figure. This subquery uses the first subquery as a nested subquery. Although this removes the extra rows, it also removes the vendor_name column. 
- Once you 're sure that both subqueries work the way you want them to, you can use them in the main query. For example, the pseudocode in this figure shows that you should join the result sets returned by the subqueries on the vendor_state and sum_of_invoices columns. In addition, the code in the previous figure shows how these two subq11eries are used in the main query. This allows you to get all of the columns you want in the final result set without any of the extra rows that you don't want.
- Writing complex queries is difficult, but following a procedure like the one shown in this figure can make it a little easier. At first, you might not be able to use pseudocode to identify subqueries. In that case, it's OK to skip ahead to step 3 and begin experimenting with possible subqueries. This may give you some ideas for how to solve the problem. Once you get these subqueries working correctly, you can begin coding a main query, and you can cut and paste the subqueries into the main query.
### A procedure for building complex queries
1. State the problem to be solved by the query in English
2. Use pseudocode to outline the query. 
3. Code the subqueries and test them to be sure that they return the correct data. 
4. Code and test the final query.
