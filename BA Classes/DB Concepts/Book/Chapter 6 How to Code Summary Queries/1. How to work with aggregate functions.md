# How to work with aggregate functions
## How to code aggregate functions
- Figure 6-1 presents the syntax of the most common aggregate functions. Most of these functions operate on an expression. Typically, the expression is just a column name. For example, you could get the average of all values in the invoice total column like this: 
- AVG(invoice total) 
- However, an expression can also be more complex. In this figure, for example, the expression that's coded for the SUM function calculates the balance due of an invoice using the invoice_total, payment_total, and credit_total columns. The result is a single value that represents the total amount due for all the selected invoices. In this case, the WHERE clause selects only those invoices with a balance due. 
- When you use these functions, you can also code the ALL or DISTINCT keyword. The ALL keyword is the default, which means that all values are included in the calculation. The exceptions are null values, which are excluded from all these functions except for COUNT(* ). 
- If you don't want duplicate values included, you can code the DISTINCT keyword. In most cases, you'll use DISTINCT only with the COUNT function as shown in the next figure. You won't use it with MIN or MAX because it has no effect on those functions. And it doesn't usually make sense to use it with the AVG and SUM functions. 
- Unlike the other aggregate functions, you can't use the ALL or DISTINCT keywords or an expression with COUNT(* ). Instead, you code this function exactly as shown in the syntax. The value returned by this function is the number of rows in the base table that satisfy the search condition of the query, including rows with null values. In this figure, for example, the COUNT(* ) function in the query indicates that the Invoices table contains 11 invoices with a balance due.

### Description
- Aggregate functions, also called column functions, perform a calculation on the values in a set of selected rows. 
- A summary query is a SELECT statement that includes one or more aggregate functions. 
- The expression you specify for the AVG and SUM functions must result in a numeric value. The expression for the MIN, MAX, and COUNT ft.1nctions can result in a numeric, date, or string value. 
- By default, all values are included in the calculation regardless of whether they're duplicated. If you want to omit duplicate values, code the DISTINCT keyword. This keyword is typically used with the COUNT function. 
- All of the aggregate functions except for COUNT( * ) ignore null values. 
- If you code an aggregate function in the SELECT clause, that clause can include non-aggregate columns from the base table if that column is functionally dependent on an aggregate column. See figure 6-3 for more information.

## Queries that use aggregate functions
- This figure presents four more queries that use aggregate functions. The first two queries use the COUNT(*) function to count the number of rows in the Invoices table that satisfy the search condition. In both cases, only those invoices with invoice dates after 1/1/2018 are included in the count. In addition, the first query uses the AVG function to calculate the average amount of those invoices and the SUM function to calculate the total amount of those invoices. In contrast, the second query uses the MIN and MAX functions to get the minimum and maximum invoice amounts. 
- Although the MIN, MAX, and COUNT functions are typically used on columns that contain numeric data, they can also be used on columns that contain character or date data. In the third query, for example, they're used on the vendor_name column in the Vendors table. Here, the MIN function returns the name of the vendor that's lowest in the sort sequence, the MAX function returns the name of the vendor that's highest in the so1t sequence, and the COUNT ft1nction returns the total number of vendors. Note that since the vendor_name column can't contain null values, the COUNT(*) function would have returned the same result. 
- The fourth query shows how using the DISTINCT keyword can affect the result of a COUNT function. Here, the first COUNT function uses the DISTINCT keyword to count the number of vendors that have invoices dated 1/1/2018 or later in the Invoices table. To do that, it looks for distinct values in the vendor_id column. In contrast, since the second COUNT function doesn't include the DISTINCT keyword, it counts every invoice that's dated 1/1/2018 or later. Although you could use the COUNT( * ) function instead, this example uses COUNT(vendor_id) to clearly show the difference between coding and not coding the DISTINCT keyword. 
- With two exceptions, a SELECT clause that contains an aggregate function can contain only aggregate functions. The first exception is if the column specification results in a literal value. This is shown by the first column in the first two queries in figure 6-2. The second exception is if the query includes a GROUP BY clause. Then, the SELECT clause can include any columns specified in the GROUP BY clause as shown in the next two figures.

### A summary query that uses the DISTINCT keyword
![[Pasted image 20220920192035.png]]
### Description
- To count all of the selected rows, you typically use the COUNT( * ) function. Alternately, you can use the COUNT function with the name of any column that can't contain null values. 
- To count only the rows with unique values in a specified column, you can code the COUNT function with the DISTINCT keyword followed by the name of the column.
