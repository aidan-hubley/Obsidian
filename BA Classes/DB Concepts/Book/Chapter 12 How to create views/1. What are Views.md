### An UPDATE statement that uses a view to update the base table
- UPDATE vendors_min
- SET vendor_phone = '(800) 555-3941'
- WHERE vendor_name = "Register of Copyrights"
### A statment that drops a view
- DROP VIEW vendors_min
### Description
- A view consists of a SELECT statement that's stored as an object in the database. The tables referenced in the SELECT statement are called the base tables for the view. 
- When you create a view, you can refer to the view anywhere you world normally use a table in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. 
- Although a view behaves like a virtual table, it doesn't store any data. Instead, a view always refers back to its base tables. 
- A view can also be referred to as a viewed table because it provides a view to the underlying base tables.
## Benefits of using views
- Figure 12-2 describes some of the advantages of using views. To start, you can use views to limit the exposure of the tables in your database to external users and applications. To illustrate, suppose a view refers to a table that you've decided to divide into two tables. To accommodate this change, you simply modify the view. In other words, you don't have to modify any statements that refer to the view. That means that users who query the database using the view don't have to be aware of the change in the database structure, and application programs that use the view don't have to be modified. 
- You can also use views to restrict access to a database. To do that, you include just the columns and rows you want a user or an application to have access to in the views. Then, you let the user or application access the data only through the views. For example, let's assume you have an Employees table that has a salary column that contains information about each employee's salary. In this case, you can create a view that doesn't include the salary column for the users who need to view and maintain this table, but who shouldn't be able to view salaries. Then, you can create another view that includes the salary column for the users who need to view and maintain salary information.
- In addition, you can use views to hide the complexity of a SELECT statement. For example, if you have a long and unwieldy SELECT statement that joins multiple tables, you can create a view for that statement. This makes it easier for you and other database users to work with this data. 
- Finally, when you create a view, you can allow data in the base table to be updated through the view. To do that, you use INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statements to work with the view.

### Description
- You can create a view on almost any SELECT statement. That means that you can code views that join tables, summarize data, and use subqueries and functions
