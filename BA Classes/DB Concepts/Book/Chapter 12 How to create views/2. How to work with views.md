# How to work with views
Now that you have a general understanding of how views work and of the benefits that they provide, you 're ready to learn the details for working with them.
## How to create a view
- Figure 12-3 presents the CREATE VIEW statement that you use to create a view. In its simplest form, you code the CREATE VIEW keywords, followed by the name of the view, followed by the AS keyword and the SELECT statement that defines the view. In this figure, for instance, the first statement creates a view named Vendors Phone List. This view includes four columns from the - - Vendors table for all vendors with invoices. 
- If you execute the first CREATE VIEW statement and a view with that name doesn't already exist in the current database, MySQL adds the view and displays a message to indicate that the statement was successful. However, if a view with this name already exists, MySQL doesn't add the view and displays a message that indicates that the name is already in use. In that case, you need to specify a new name for the view, or you need to drop the view that's already using that name. 
- When you code a CREATE VIEW statement, you can specify that you want to automatically drop a view that has the same name as the view that you're creating. To do that, you can specify the OR REPLACE keywords after the CREATE keyword as shown in all of the examples in this figure except for the first.
- The SELECT statement for a view can use most of the features of a normal SELECT statement. In this figure, for instance, the second example creates a view that joins data from two tables. Similarly, the third statement creates a view that uses a LIMIT clause. 
- By default, the columns in a view are given the same names as the columns in the base tables. If a view contains a calculated column, however, you'll want to name that column just as you do in other SELECT statements. In addition, you'll need to rename columns from different tables that have the same name. To do that, you can code the column names in the CREATE VIEW clause as shown in the fourth example. Or, you can use the AS clause in the SELECT statement as shown in the fifth example. 
- Note that if you use the technique shown in the fourth example, you have to assign names to all of the columns. By contrast, if you use the technique shown in the fifth example, you only have to assign names to the columns you need to rename. As a result, you'll typically want to use the technique presented in the fifth example.

- The example in part 2 of figu1·e 12-3 creates a view that summarizes the rows in the Invoices table by vendor. This shows that a view can use agg1·egate functions and the GROUP BY clause to summarize data. In this case, the rows are grouped by vendor name, and a count of the invoices and the invoice total are calculated for each vendor.
- When you create a view, the SELECT statement you code within the definition of the view can refer to another view instead of a base table. In other words, views can be nested. In theory, nested views can make it easier to present data to your users. In practice, using nested views can make the dependencies between tables and views confusing, which can make your code difficult to maintain. As a result, if you use nested views, you should use them careful!

### Description
- You use the CREATE VIEW statement to create a view.
- If you include the OR REPLACE keywords, the CREATE VIEW statement will replace any existing view that has the same name. Otherwise, you must specify a name that doesn't already exist for the view. 
- If you name the columns of a view in the CREATE VIEW clause, you have to name all of the columns. By contrast, if you name the columns in the SELECT clause, you can name just the columns you need to rename. 
- You can create a view that's based on another view rather than on a table. This is known as a nested view.

## How to create an updatable view
- Once you create a view, you can refer to it in a SELECT statement. In addition, you may be able to refer to it in INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to modify the data that's stored in an underlying table. To do that, the view must be updatable. Figure 12-4 lists the requirements for creating updatable views. 
- The first two requirements have to do with what you can code in the select list of the SELECT statement that defines the view. In particular, the select list can't include the DISTINCT keyword or aggregate functions. In addition, the SELECT statement can't include a GROUP BY or HAVING clause, and two SELECT statements can' t be joined by a union operation. 
- The CREATE VIEW statement in this figure creates a view that's updatable. As a result, you can refer to it in an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. For example, you can use the first UPDATE statement shown in this figure to update the credit_total column in the Invoices base table. Note that to execute this statement in MySQL Workbench, you will need to turn safe update mode off as described in chapter 5, since the WHERE clause doesn't refer to a primary or foreign key. 
- However, you can't update any calculated columns that are used by the view. For example, you can't use the second UPDATE statement shown in this figure to update the balance_due column that's calculated from the other columns in the view.
- In addition, when you update data through a view, you can only update the data in a single base table at a time, even if the view refers to two or more tables. In this figure, for instance, the view includes data from two base tables: Vendors and Invoices. Because of that, you can code an UPDATE statement that updates the data in the Vendors table or the data in the Invoices table, but not in both tables. For example, the first UPDATE statement only refers to columns in the Invoices table, so it's able to update data in that table.
### Requirements for creating updatable views
- The select list can't include a DISTINCT clause. 
- The select list can't include aggregate functions. 
- The SELECT statement can't include a GROUP BY or HAVING clause. 
- The view can' t include the UNION operator.

### Description
- An updatable view is a view that can be used in an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement to update the data in the base table. If a view isn't updatable, it's called a read-only view. 
- The requirements for coding updatable views are more restrictive than for coding read-only views. That's because MySQL must be able to unambiguously determine which base tables and columns are affected.
## How to use the WITH CHECK OPTION clause
- Figure 12-5 shows an example of an updatable view that uses the WITH CHECK OPTION clause to prevent an update if it causes the row to be excluded from the view. To start, the CREATE VIEW statement creates an updatable view named Vendor_Payment that joins data from the Vendors and Invoices tables and retrieves all invoices that have a balance due that's greater than or equal to zero. 
- Then, the first UPDATE statement uses this view to modify the payment_date and payment_total columns for a specific invoice. This works because this UPDATE statement doesn't exclude the row from the view. 
- However, the second UPDATE statement causes the balance due to become less than zero. As a result, this statement fails due to the WITH CHECK OPTION clause, and an error is displayed. Since this can prevent users from storing invalid data in a database, this clause can be useful in some situations.

### Description
- If you don' t include a WITH CHECK OPTION clause when you create a view, a change you make through the view can cause the modified rows to no longer be included in the view. 
- If you specify a WITH CHECK OPTION clause when you create a view, an error will occur if you try to modify a row in such a way that it would no longer be included in the view.
## How to insert or delete rows through a view
- In the previous figures, you learned how to use a view to update data in the underlying tables. Now, figure 12-6 shows how to use a view to insert or delete data in an underlying table. In general, this works the same as it does when you work directly with a table. However, due to table constraints, using a view to insert or delete rows often results in errors like the ones shown in this figure. As a result, it's generally more common to work directly with base tables when inserting or deleting rows. 
- At the top of this figure, you can see a CREATE VIEW statement for a view named IBM invoices. This view retrieves columns and rows from the Invoices - table for the vendor named IBM, which has a vendor_id of 34. Then, the INSERT statement that follows attempts to insert a row into the Invoices table through this view. 
- This insert operation fails, though, because the view and the INSERT statement don't include all of the required columns for the Invoices table. In this case, a value is required for other columns in the Invoices table, including the vendor_id and invoice_due_date columns. As a result, to use a view to insert rows, you must design a view that includes all required columns for the under-lying table. 
- In addition, an INSERT statement that uses a view can insert rows into only one table. That's true even if the view is based on two or more tables and all of the required columns for tl1ose tables are included in the view. In that case, you could use a separate INSERT statement to insert rows into each table through the view. 
- This figure also shows how to delete rows through a view. To do that, you use a DELETE statement like the ones shown here. To start, the first DELETE statement attempts to delete an invoice from the Invoices table through the ibm_invoices view. However, this DELETE statement fails because the Invoice_Line_Items table contains rows related to the invoice. This causes an error message like the one in this figure to be displayed. To get this DELETE statement to work, you must first delete the related line items for the invoice. This is illustrated by the last two DELETE statements in this figure.

### Description
- You can use the INSERT statement to insert rows into a base table through a view. To do that, you name the view in the INSERT clause. Both the view and the INSERT statement must include all of the columns from the base table that require a value. 
- If the view names more than one base table, an INSERT statement can insert data into only one of those tables. 
- You can use the DELETE statement to delete rows from a base table through a view. To do that, you name the view in the DELETE clause. For this to work, the view must be based on a single table.
## How to alter or drop a view
- Although MySQL supports an ALTER VIEW statement, it's usually easier to alter a view by using the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement to replace the existing view with a new one. In figure 12-7, for instance, the first example uses a CREATE VIEW statement to create a view named vendors_sw that retrieves rows from the Vendors table for vendors located in four states. Then, the second example uses the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement to modify this view so it includes vendors in two additional states. 
- To drop a view, you use the DROP VIEW statement to name the view you want to drop. In this figure, for instance, the third example drops the view named vendors_sw. Like the other statements for dropping database objects, this statement permanently deletes the view. As a result, you should be careful when you use it.

### Description
- To alter a view, use the CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW statement to replace the existing view with a new one. 
- To delete a view from the database, use the DROP VIEW statement.
