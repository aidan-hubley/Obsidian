# How to convert data
- As you work with the various data types, you'll find that you frequently need to convert data from one type to another. Although MySQL performs many conversions automatically, it doesn't always perform the conversion the way you want. Because of that, you need to be aware of how data conversion works, and you need to know when and how to specify the type of conversion you want.
## How implicit data conversion works
- Before MySQL can operate on two values, it must convert those values to the same data type. To understand how this works, consider the three expressions shown in figu.re 8-8. 
- In the first example, the second column joins a string literal of''$'' to the invoice_total column, which is defined with the DECIMAL type. As a result, MySQL converts the DECIMAL value to its corresponding characters, appends those characters to the $ character, and stores them as a CHAR type. 
- In the second example, the second column divides the INT literal of 989319 by the VARCHAR type that's stored in the invoice_number column. As a result, MySQL attempts to convert the invoice_number column to an INT type before it perfor1ns the division operation. If the invoice_number column contains only numbers, this works as you would expect. However, if the invoice_number column contains letters or special characters, MySQL converts only the numeric characters that precede the letters or special characters. For example, in the first row in the result set, MySQL only converts the numbers before the dash in the invoice number column. 
- In the third example, the second column adds an INT literal of 1 to the invoice_date column, which is defined with the DATE type. As a result, MySQL converts the DATE value in the invoice date column to an INT valt1e before it performs the addition. In the result set, the first column uses the DATE type, which includes dashes between the parts of the date. The second column, on the other hand, uses the INT type, which doesn't include dashes between parts of the date. 
- Notice in the third row of this result set that after 1 is added to the date, the date is invalid. Because MySQL doesn't check if the resulting date is valid when you perform an arithmetic operation like this, you're not likely to use the arithmetic operators with dates. Instead, you'll use the functions for performing calculations on dates that are presented in the next chapter. 
- When MySQL performs a conversion automatically, it's called an implicit conversion. However, if you want to control how a conversion is performed, you can code an explicit conversion. To do that, you can use the CAST and CONVERT functions shown in the next figure.

### Description
- When MySQL automatically converts one data type to another, it's known as an implicit conversion. 
- If you code an expression that involves values with different data types, MySQL implicitly converts them when it evaluates the expression. 
- If you use a string in a numeric expression, MySQL attempts to convert the string to a number before evaluating the expression. If the string starts with a letter or special character, MySQL returns a value of zero. If it starts with a number, MySQL returns that number and each successive number until it encounters a letter or special character. 
- If you add or subtract an integer to or from a DATE value, MySQL implicitly converts the DATE value to an integer value.

## How to convert data using the CAST and CONVERT functions
- Because MySQL's rules for implicit conversion are more flexible than those for other SQL databases, you generally don't need to explicitly convert data from one type to another. However, whenever necessary, you can use the CAST and CONVERT functions to convert, or cast, an expression to the data type you specify as shown in figure 8-9. Since CAST is an ANSI-standard function, it is used more freqt1ently than CONVERT, but both functions work equally well for most tasks. 
- The first SELECT statement shows how to use the CAST function. Here, the fourth column in the result set casts the DATE values of the invoice date colu1nn to CHAR values. Although the fourth column looks the same as the second column, it stores a CHAR value, not a DATE value. In this case, MySQL converted all of the characters in the DATE value to a CHAR value. If that's not what you want, you can truncate the number of characters in the result by specifying a value less than 10 after the CHAR keyword. 
- The fifth column in the result set casts the DECIMAL values in the invoice_total column to signed INT values. Before the digits to the right of the decimal point are dropped, the numbers are rounded to the nearest whole number. For brevity, this statement only t1ses the SIGNED keyword. For clarity, it could also include the optional INTEGER keyword immediately after the SIGNED keyword. 
- The second SELECT statement in this figure shows how to use the CONVERT function. If you compare this statement to the first SELECT statement, you'll see that it uses a slightly different syntax. However, both SELECT statements accomplish the same task.
### The syntax of the CAST function
- CAST(expression AS cast_type)
### The syntax of the CONVERT function
- CONVERT(expression, cast_type)

### Description
- You can use the CAST or CONVERT function to perform an explicit conversion. This allows you to convert, or cast, an expression from one data type to another. 
- CAST is an ANSI-standard function and is used more frequently than CONVERT.

## How to convert data using the FORMAT and CHAR functions
- functions that perform other types of data conversion. In particular, it provides the FORMAT and CHAR functions shown in figure 8-10. 
- You can use the FORMAT function to convert a number to a string of characters. This function uses commas to group the thousands to the left of the decimal point. This makes large numbers easier to read. In addition, the FORMAT function rounds the number to the specified number of decimal places. If you specify O decimal places, the function returns a string that doesn't include a decimal point. 
- The CHAR function returns a binary string for each specified integer. This function is typically used to output ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) control characters that can't be typed on your keyboard. The three most common control characters are presented in this figure. These characters can be used to format output so it's easy to read. In this figure, for example, the SELECT statement uses the CHAR(l3) and CHAR(l O) control characters to start new lines after the vendor name and vendor address in the output.
