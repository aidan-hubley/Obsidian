### A SELECT statement that uses a searched CASE function
![[Pasted image 20221004212929.png]]
### Description
- Tl1e simple CASE function tests the expression in the CASE clause against the expressions in the WHEN clauses. Then, the function returns the result expression for the first test that's true.
- The searched CASE function tests the expression in each WHEN clause and returns the result expression for the first test that's true.

## How to use the IF, IFNULL, and COALESCE functions

### The syntax of the IFNULL function

### A SELECT statement that uses the IFNULL function

### The syntax of the COALESCE function

### A SELECT statement that uses the COALESCE function
![[Pasted image 20221004214507.png]]
### Description
- The IF function lets you test an expression and return one value if the expression is true and another value if the expression is false. 
- The IFNULL and COALESCE functions let you substitute non-null values for null values. 
- The IFNULL function returns the first expression if it isn't null. Otherwise, it returns the replacement value you specify. 
- The COALESCE function returns the first expression in the list that isn't null. If all of the expressions are null, this function returns a null value.

## How to use the regular expression function
### The syntax of the regular expression functions

### Regular expression special characters and constructs

### Examples of the regular expressions functions
![[Pasted image 20221004214720.png]]
### Description 
- The regular expression functions use a string pattern to search a string expression. These patterns can use special characters and constructs, which are case-insensitive by default.
### A statement that uses the REGEXP_INSTR function

### A statement that uses the REGEXP_SUBSTR function

### A statement that uses the REGEXP_REPLACE and REGEXP_LIKE functions
![[Pasted image 20221004214853.png]]
### Description 
- The REGEXP_LIKE function works just like the REGEXP operator that you learned about in chapter 3. 
- The REGEXP_REPLACE function replaces the occurrences of the regular expression pattern only in the result set. The database table re1nains unchanged.

## How to use the ranking functions
### The syntax pf the four ranking functions

### A query that uses the ROW_NUMBER function
![[Pasted image 20221004215014.png]]
### A query that uses the PARTITION BY clause
![[Pasted image 20221004215049.png]]
### Description
- The ROW_NUMBER, RANK, DENSE_RANK, and NTILE functions were introduced with MySQL 8.0. They are sometimes referred to as ranking functions. 
- The ORDER BY clause determines the sequence of the rows within the partitions. 
- The optional PARTITION BY clause specifies the column that's used to divide the result set into groups called partitions. 
- The ROW_NUMBER function returns the number of the current row within its partition, starting at 1 for the first row in each partition.

### A query that uses the RANK and DENSE_RANK functions
![[Pasted image 20221004215214.png]]
### Description
- The RANK and DENSE_RANK functions both return the rank of each row within the partition of a result set. 
- If there is a tie, both of these functions give the same rank to all rows that are tied. 
- To determine the rank for the next distinct row, the RANK function adds 1 to the total number of rows, while the DENSE_RANK function adds 1 to the rank for the previous row.
### A query that uses the NTILE function
![[Pasted image 20221004215302.png]]
### Description
- The NTILE function divides the rows in a partition into the specified number of groups and returns the group number of each row. 
- If the rows can' t be evenly divided into groups, the later groups may have one less row than the earlier groups.

## How to use the analytic functions
### The syntax of the analytic functions

### The columns in the Sales_Reps and Sales_Totals table
![[Pasted image 20221004215422.png]]
### A query that uses FIRST_VALUE, NTH_VALUE, and LAST_VALUE functions
![[Pasted image 20221004215524.png]]
### Description
- The FIRST_ VALUE, LAST_ VALUE, NTH VALUE, LEAD, LAG, PERCENT_RANK, and CUME_DIST functions are sometimes referred to as analytic functions. They were introduced with MySQL 8.0. 
- The FIRST_ VALUE, LAST_VALUE, and NTH_ VALUE functions return the first, last, and nth value in a sorted set of values. When you use the PARTITION BY clause with LAST_ VALUE or NTH_VALUE, you typically include the ROWS or RANGE clause as well to define a subset of the current partition.

### A query that uses the LAG function
![[Pasted image 20221004215611.png]]
### A query that uses the PERCENT_RANK and CUME_DIST functions
![[Pasted image 20221004215637.png]]
### Description
- The LEAD function retrieves data from a following row in a result set, and the LAG function retrieves data from a previous row in a result set. 
- The PERCENT_RANK function calculates the rank of the values in a sorted set of values as a percent. The CUME_DIST ft1nction calculates the percent of the values in a sorted set of values that are less than or equal to the current value.
