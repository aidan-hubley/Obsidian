# How to code the ORDER BY clause
The ORDER BY clause specifies the sort order for the rows in a 1·esult set. In most cases, you'll use column names from the base table to specify the sort order as you saw in some of the examples earlier in this chapter. However, you can also use other techniques to sort the rows in a result set, as described in the topics that follow.
## How to sort by a column name
- Figure 3-16 presents the expanded syntax of the ORDER BY clause. This syntax shows that you can sort by one or more expressions in either ascending or descending sequence. The three examples in this figure show how to code this clause for expressions that involve column names. 
- The first two examples show how to sort the rows in a result set by a single column. In the first example, the rows in the Vendors table are sorted in ascending sequence by the vendor_name column. Since ascending is the default sequence, the ASC keyword can be omitted. In the second example, the rows are sorted by the vendor_name column in descending sequence. 
- To sort by more than one column, you simply list the names in the ORDER BY clause separated by commas as shown in the third example. This can be referred to as a nested sort because one sort is nested within another. Here, the rows in the Vendors table are first sorted by the vendor_state column in ascending sequence. Then, within each state, the rows are sorted by the vendor_city column in ascending sequence. Finally, within each city, the rows are sorted by the vendor_name column in ascending sequence.

### An ORDER BY clause that sorts by three columns

### Description
- The ORDER BY clause specifies how you want the rows in the result set sorted. You can sort by one or more columns, and you can sort each column in either ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) sequence. ASC is the default. 
- By default, in an ascending sort, special characters appear first in the sort sequence, followed by numbers, then letters. This sort order is determined by the character set used by the server, which you can change when you start the server. 
- Null values appear first in the sort sequence, even if you 're using DESC. 
- You can sort by any column in the base table regardless of whether it's included in the SELECT clause.

## How to sort by an alias, expression, or column number
- Figure 3-17 presents three more techniques that you can use to specify sort columns. First, you can use a column alias that's defined in the SELECT clause. The first SELECT statement in this figure, for example, sorts by a column named Address, which is an alias for the concatenation of the vendor_city, vendor_state, and vendor_zip_code columns. Notice that within the Address column, the result set is also sorted by the vendor_name column. 
- You can also use an arithmetic or string expression in the ORDER BY clause, as shown by the second example in this figure. Here, the expression consists of the vendor_contact_last_name column concatenated with the vendor_contact_first_name column. Notice that neither of these columns is included in the SELECT clause. Although MySQL allows this coding technique, many other SQL dialects don't. 
- The last example in this figure shows how you can use column numbers to specify a sort order. To use this technique, you code the number that corresponds to the column of the result set, where 1 is the first column, 2 is the second column, and so on. In this example, the ORDER BY clause sorts the result set by the second column, which contains the concatenated address, then by the first column, which contains the vendor name. As a result, this statement returns the same result set that's returned by the first statement. 
- However, the statement that uses column numbers is more difficult to read because you have to look at the SELECT clause to see what columns the numbers refer to. In addition, if you add or remove columns from the SELECT clause, you may also have to change the ORDER BY clause to reflect the new column positions. As a result, you should avoid using this technique in most situations.

### An ORDER BY clause that uses column positions

### Description
- The ORDER BY clause can include a column alias that's specified in the SELECT clause if the column alias does not include spaces. 
- The ORDER BY clause can include any valid expression. The expression can refer to any column in the base table, even if it isn't included in the result set. 
- The ORDER BY clause can use numbers to specify the columns to use for sorting. In that case, 1 represents the first column in the result set, 2 represents the second column, and so on.

# How to code the LIMIT clause
- The LIMIT clause specifies the maximum number of rows that are returned in the result set. For most queries, you want to see the entire result set so you won't use this clause. However, there may be times when you want to retrieve just a subset of a larger result set. 
- Figure 3-18 presents the expanded syntax of the LIMIT clause. This clause can take one or two arguments as shown by the three examples in this figure. 
## How to limit the number of rows 
- In its simplest form, you code the LIMIT clause with a single numeric argument. Then, the number of rows in the result set is, at most, the number you specify. But if the result set is smaller than the number you specify, the LIMIT clause has no effect. 
- In the first example, the SELECT state1nent includes the LIMIT 5 clause, so the entire result set is five rows. Without the LIMIT clause, this statement would return 114 rows. Because the result set is sorted by invoice_total in descending sequence, this result set represents the five largest invoices. 
## How to return a range of rows 
- If you code the optional offset argument of the LIMIT clause, it represents an offset, or starting point for the result set. This offset starts from a value of 0, which refers to the first row in the result set. In the second example, then, the offset is 2 so the result set starts with the third invoice. Then, since the row count is 3, the result set contains just 3 rows. 
- Similarly, the third example bas an offset of 100, so the result set starts with row 101. Note that the row count for the LIMIT clause in this example is 1000. Since the table contains only 114 rows, though, the result set contains just the last 14 rows in the table.

### A SELECT with a LIMIT clause that starts with the 101st row
![[Pasted image 20220908225641.png]]
### Description
- You can use the LIMIT clause to limit the number of rows returned by the SELECT statement. This clause takes one or two intege1· arguments. 
- If you code a single argument, it specifies the maximum row count, beginning with the first row. If you code both arguments, the offset specifies the first row to return, where the offset of the first row is 0. 
- If you want to retrieve all of the rows from a certain offset to the end of the result set, code -1 for the row count. 
- Typically, you'll use an ORDER BY clause whenever you use the LIMIT clause.![[]]
