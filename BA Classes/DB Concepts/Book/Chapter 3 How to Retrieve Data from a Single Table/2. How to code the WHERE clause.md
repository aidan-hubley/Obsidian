# How to code the WHERE clause
Earlier in this chapter, I mentioned that to improve performance, you should code your SELECT statements so they retrieve only the columns you need. That goes for retrieving rows too: The fewer rows you retrieve, the more efficient the statement will be. Because of that, you typically include a WHERE clause on your SELECT statements with a search condition that filters the rows in the base table so only the rows you need are retrieved. In the topics that follow, you'll learn a variety of ways to code this clause.
## How to use the comparison operators
- Figure 3-10 shows how to use the comparison operators in the search condition of a WHERE clause to compare two expressions. If the result of the comparison is true, the row being tested is included in the query results. 
- The examples in this figure show how to use the comparison operators. The first WHERE clause, for example, uses the equal operator(=) to retrieve only those rows whose vendor_state column has a value of 'IA' . Here, the state code is a string literal so it must be enclosed in single or double quotes. In contrast, the second WHERE clause uses the greater than (>) operator to retrieve only those rows that have a balance greater than zero. In this case, zero (0) is a numeric literal so it isn't enclosed in quotes. 
- The third WHERE clause shows another way to retrieve all the invoices with a balance due by rearranging the comparison expression. Like the second clause, it uses the greater than operator. Instead of comparing the balance due to a valt1e of zero, however, it compares the invoice total to the total of the payments and credits that have been applied to the invoice. 
- The fourth WHERE clause shows how you can use comparison operators other than equal wit11 string data. In this example, the less than operator (<)is used to compare the value of the vendor_name column to a literal string that contains the letter M . That causes the query to return all vendors with names that begin with the letters A through L. 
- You can also use the comparison operators with date literals, as shown by the fifth and sixth WHERE clauses. The fifth clause retrieves rows with invoice dates on or before July 31, 2018, and the sixth clause retrieves rows with invoice dates on 01· after July 1, 2018. Like literal values for strings, literal values for dates must be enclosed in single or double quotes. Also, literal values for dates must use this format: YYYY-MM-DD. This is the default date format used by MySQL. 
- The last two WHERE clauses show how you can test for a not-equal condition. In both cases, only rows with a credit total that isn't equal to zero are retrieved. 
- Whenever possible, you should compare expressions that have similar data types. If you compare expressions that have different data types, MySQL implicitly converts the data type for you. Generally, this implicit conversion is acceptable. However, implicit conversions can occasionally yield unexpected results. To prevent this, you can explicitly convert the data type by using the CAST or CONVERT functions, which you'll learn about in chapter 8.
### The syntax of the WHERE clause with comparison operators
- WHERE expression_1 operator expression_2
### The comparison operators
|-|-|
|-|-|
| = | Equal |
| < | Less Equal | 
|<=|Less than or equal to
|>=|Greater than or equal to
|<>|Not Equal
|!=|Not Equal|
### Examples of WHERE clauses that retrieve...
#### Vendors located in Iowa 
WHERE vendor_ state = 'IA' 
#### Invoices with a balance due (two variations) 
WHERE invoice_ total - payment_ total - credit_ total > 0 
WHERE invoice_ total > payment_ total + credit total 
#### Vendors with names from A to L 
WHERE vendor_ name < 'M' 
#### Invoices on or before a specified date 
WHERE invoice date <= '2018-07-31' 
#### Invoices on or after a specified date 
WHERE invoice_date >= '2018-07-01' 
#### Invoices with credits that don't equal zero (two variations) 
WHERE credit_ total <> 0 
WHERE credit_ total != 0

### Description
- You can use a comparison operator to compare any two expressions. Since MySQL automatically converts the data for comparison, the expressions may be of unlike data types. However, the comparison may sometimes produce unexpected results. 
- If the result of a comparison is a true value, the row being tested is included in the result set. If it's a false or null value, the row isn't included. 
- To use a string literal or a date literal in a comparison, enclose it in quotes. To use a numeric literal, enter the number without quotes. 
- Character comparisons performed on MySQL databases are not case-sensitive. So, for example, 'CA' and 'ca' are considered equivalent. 
- If you compare a null value using one of these comparison operators, the result is always a null value. To test for null values, use the IS NULL clause presented in figure 3-15.

## How to use the AND, OR, and NOT, logical operators
- Figure 3-11 shows how to use logical operators in a WHERE clause. You can use the AND and OR operators to combine two or more search conditions into a compound condition. And you can use the NOT operator to negate a search condition. The examples in this figure show how these operators work. 
- The first two examples show the AND and OR operators. When you use the AND operator, both conditions must be true. So, in the first example, only those vendors in the state of New Jersey and the city of Springfield are retrieved from the Vendors table. When you use the OR operator, though, only 011e of the conditions must be true. So, in the second example, all the vendors in the state of New Jersey and all the vendors in the city of Pittsburg (no matter what state) are retrieved. 
- The third example shows how to use the NOT operator to negate a condition. Here, vendors that are not in the state of California are returned. The fourth example shows a compound condition that uses two NOT operators. This condition is difficult to understand. To make it easier to understand, you can rewrite this condition to remove the NOT operators as shown in the fifth example. 
- The last two examples in this figure show how the order of precedence for the logical operators and the use of parentheses affect the result of a search condition. By default, the NOT operator is evaluated first, followed by AND, and then by OR. However, you can use parentheses to override the order of precedence or to clarify a logical expression, just as you can with arithmetic expressions. 
- In the next to last example, for instance, no parentheses are used, so the two conditions connected by the AND operator are evaluated first. In the last example, though, parentheses are used so the two conditions connected by the OR operator are evaluated first. If you take a minute to review the results in this figure, you should quickly see how these two conditions differ.
### The syntax of the WHERE clause with logical operators
- WHERE [NOT] search_condition_1 {AND|OR} [NOT] search_condition_2 ...
### Examples of WHERE clauses that use logical operators
#### The AND operator
- WHERE vendor_state = 'NJ' AND vendor_city = 'Springfield'
#### The OR operator
- WHERE vendor_state = 'NJ' OR vendor_city = 'Pittsburg'
#### The NOT operator
- WHERE NOT vendor_state = 'CA'
#### The NOT operator in a complex search condition
- WHERE NOT (invoices_total >= 5000 OR NOT invoice_date <= '2018-08-01')
#### The same condition rephrased to eliminate the NOT operator
- WHERE invoice_total < 5000 AND invoices_date <= '2018-08-01'
### A compound condition without parentheses
![[Pasted image 20220908222403.png]]
### The same compound condition with parentheses
![[Pasted image 20220908222424.png]]
### Description
- You can use the AND and OR logical operators to create compound conditions that consist of two or more conditions. You use the AND operator to specify that the search must satisfy both of the conditions, and you use the OR operator to specify that the search must satisfy at least one of the conditions. 
- You can use the NOT operator to negate a condition. Because this can make the search condition unclear, you should rephrase the condition if possible so it doesn't use NOT. 
- When MySQL evaluates a compound condition, it evaluates the operators in this sequence: (1) NOT, (2) AND, and (3) OR. You can use parentheses to override this order of precedence or to clarify the sequence in which the operations are evaluated.

## How to use the IN operator
- Figure 3-12 shows how to code a WHERE clause that uses the IN operator. When you use this operator, the value of the test expression is compared with the list of expressions in the IN phrase. If the test expression is equal to one of the expressions in the list, the row is included in the query results. This is shown by the first example in this figure, which returns all rows whose terms_id column is equal to 1, 3, or 4. 
- You can also use the NOT operator with the IN phrase to test for a value that's not in a list of expressions. This is shown by the second example. Here, only those vendors that aren't in California, Nevada, or Oregon are retrieved. 
- At the top of this figure, the syntax of the IN phrase shows that you can code a subquery in place of a list of expressions. As you'll learn in chapter 7, subqueries are a powerful feature. For now, though, you should know that a subquery is simply a SELECT statement within another statement. 
- In the third example, for instance, a subquery is used to return a list of vendor_id values for vendors who have invoices dated July 18, 2018. Then, the WHERE clause retrieves a row only if the vendor_id is in that list. Note that for this to work, the subquery must return a single column, in this case, vendor_id.
### The syntax of the WHERE clause with an IN phrase
- WHERE test_expression [NOT] IN 
	- ({subquerylexpression_ l [, expression_2 ] ... })
### Examples of the IN phrase
#### An IN phrase with a list of numeric literals
- WHERE terms_id IN (1, 2, 3)
#### An IN phrase preceded by NOT
- WHERE vendor_state NOT IN ('CA', 'NV', 'OR')
#### An IN phrase with a subquery
- WHERE vendor_id IN
	- ( SELECT vendor_id
	- FROM invoices
	- WHERE invoice_date = '2018-07-18')
### Description
- You can use the IN phrase to test whether an expression is equal to a value in a list of expressions. Each of the expressions in the list is automatically converted to the same type of data as the test expression. 
- The list of expressions can be coded in any order without affecting the order of the rows in the result set. 
- You can use the NOT operator to test for an expression that's not in the list of expressions. 
- You can also compare the test expression to the items in a list returned by a subquery. You'll learn more about coding subqueries in chapter 7.

## How to use the BETWEEN operator
- Figure 3-13 shows how to use the BETWEEN operator in a WHERE clause. When you use this operator, the value of a test expression is compared to the range of values specified in the BETWEEN phrase. If the value falls within this range, the row is included in the query results. 
- The first example in this figure shows a simple WHERE clause that uses the BETWEEN operator. It retrieves invoices with invoice dates between June 1, 2018 and June 30, 2018. Note that the range is inclusive, so invoices with invoice dates of June 1 and June 30 are included in the results. 
- The second example shows how to use the NOT operator to select rows that aren't within a given range. In this case, vendors with zip codes that aren't between 93600 and 93799 are included in the results. 
- The third example shows bow you can use a calculated value in the test expression. Here, the payment_total and credit_total columns are subtracted from the invoice_total column to give the balance due. Then, this value is compared to the range specified in the BETWEEN phrase. 
- The last example shows how you can use calculated values in the BETWEEN phrase. Here, the first value is the credit_total column and the second value is the credit_total column plus 500. So the results include all those invoices where the amount paid is between the credit amount and $500 more than the credit amount.
### The syntax of the WHERE clause with a BETWEEN phrase
- WHERE test_expression [NOT] BETWEEN begin_expression AND end_expression
### Examples of the BETWEEN phrase
#### A BETWEEN phrase with literal values
- WHERE invoice_date BETWEEN '2018-06-01' AND '2019-06-30'
#### A BETWEEN phrase preceded by NOT
- WHERE vendor_ zip_ code NOT BETWEEN 93600 AND 93799
#### A BETWEEN phrase with a test expression coded as a calculated value 
- WHERE invoice_ total - payment_ total - credit_ total BETWEEN 200 AND 500 
#### A BETWEEN phrase with the upper and lower limits coded as calculated values 
- WHERE payment_ total BETWEEN credit_ total AND credit_ total + 500
### Description
- You can use the BETWEEN phrase to test whether an expression falls within a range of values. The lower limit must be coded as the first expression, and the upper limit must be coded as the second expression. Otherwise, MySQL returns an empty result set. 
- The two expressions used in the BETWEEN phrase for the range of values are inclusive. That is, the result set includes values that are equal to the upper or lower limit. 
- You can use the NOT operator to test for an expression that's not within the given range.

## How to use the LIKE and REGEXP operators
- To retrieve rows that match a specific string pattern, or mask, you can use the LIKE or REGEXP operators as shown in figure 3-14. The LIKE operator is an older operator that lets you search for simple string patterns. When you use this operator, the mask can contain one or both of the wildcard symbols shown in the first table in this figure. 
- In contrast to the LIKE operator, the REGEXP operator allows you to create complex string patterns known as regular expressions. To do that, you can use the special characters and constructs shown in the second table in this figure. Although creating regular expressions can be tricky at first, they allow you to search for virtually any string pattern. 
- In the first example in this figure, the LIKE phrase specifies that all vendors in cities that start with the letters SAN should be included in the query results. Here, the percent sign (%) indicates that any character or characters can follow these three letters. So San Diego and Santa Ana are both included in the results. The second example selects all vendors whose vendor name starts with the letters COMPU, followed by any one character, the letters ER, and any characters after that. The vendor names Compuserve and Computerworld both match that pattern. 
- In the third example, the REGEXP phrase searches for the letters SA within the vendor_city column. Since the letters can be in any position within the string, both Pasadena and Santa Ana are included in the results. 
- The next two examples demonstrate how to use REGEXP to match a pattern to the beginning or end of the string being tested. In the fourth example, the mask ^SA matches the letters SA at the beginning of vendor_city, as in Santa Ana and Sacramento. In contrast, the mask NA$ matches the letters NA at the end of vendor_city, as shown in the fifth example. 
- The sixth example uses the pipe ( I ) character to search for either of two string patterns: RS or SN. In this case, the first pattern would match Traverse City and the second would match Fresno, so both are included in the result set. 
- The last four examples use brackets to specify multiple values. In the seventh example, the vendor_state column is searched for values that contain the letter N followed by either C or V. That excludes NJ and NY. In contrast, the eighth example searches for states that contain the letter N followed by any letter from A to J. This excludes NV and NY. 
- The ninth example searches the values in the vendor_contact_last_name column for a name that can be spelled two different ways: Damien or Damion. To do that, the mask specifies the two possible characters in the fifth position, E and 0 , within brackets. In the final example, the REGEXP phrase searches for a vendor_city that ends with any letter, a vowel, and then the letter N. 
- Both the LIKE and REGEXP operators provide powerful functionality for finding information in a database. However, searches that use these operators sometimes run slowly since they can' t use a table's indexes. As a result, you should only use these operators when necessary.

### WHERE clauses that use the LIKE and REGEXP operators
![[Pasted image 20220908224034.png]]
### Description
- You use the LIKE and REGEXP operators to retrieve rows that match a string pattern, called a mask. The mask determines which values in the column satisfy the condition. 
- The mask for a LIKE phrase can contain special symbols, called wildcards. The mask for a REGEXP phrase can contain special characters and constructs. Masks aren't case-sensitive. 
- If you use the NOT keyword, only those rows with values that don't match the string pattern are included in the result set. 
- Most LIKE and REGEXP phrases significantly degrade performance compared to other types of searches, so use them only when necessary.
- For the sake of brevity, this chapter only presents the most common symbols that are used in regular expressions. However, MySQL supports most of the symbols that rule standard for creating regular expressions. For more information about creating regular expressions, please consult the online MySQL Reference Manual. If you 're familiar with using regular expressions in other programming languages such as PHP, you'll find that they work similarly in MySQL. 
- In addition to the REGEXP operator, MySQL 8.0 provides some new functions that work with regular expressions. You'll learn about these functions in chapter 9 when you learn about some other functions for working with strings.

## How to use the IS NULL clause
- In chapter 1, you learned that a column can contain a null value. A null value is typically used to indicate that a value is not known. A null value is not the same as an empty string (' '). An empty st1·ing is typically used to indicate that the value is known, and it doesn't exist. 
- If you're working with a database that allows null values, you need to know how to test for them in search conditions. To do that, you use the IS NULL clause as shown in figure 3-15. This figure uses a table named Null_Sample to show how to search for null values. 
- This table contains two columns: invoice id and invoice total. The - - values in this table are displayed in the first example. 
- The second example shows what happens when you retrieve all the rows with invoice_total equal to zero. In this case, the row that has a null value isn't included in the result set. As the third example shows, this row isn't included in the result set when invoice_total isn't equal to zero either. Instead, you have to use the IS NULL clause to retrieve rows with null values, as shown by the fourth example. 
- You can also use the NOT operator with the IS NULL clause, as shown by the last example. When you use this operator, all of the rows that don't contain null values are included in the query results.
### The syntax of the WHERE clause with the IS NULL clause

### A SELECT statement that retrieves rows with null values
![[Pasted image 20220908224503.png]]
### A SELECT statement that retrieves rows without null values
![[Pasted image 20220908224528.png]]
### Description
- A null value represents a value that's unknown, unavailable, or not applicable. It isn't the same as a zero or an empty string(").
