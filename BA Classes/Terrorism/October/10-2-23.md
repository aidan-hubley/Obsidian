	- Violence - Divine Duty or even a sacramental act
		- Religious texts or religious authorities often legitimize violence
	- Political, moral, and other constraints often disregarded -- WHY?
- Often seek overthrow of existing system 
- Non-members as "enemies" -> elimination necessary to achieve goals
	- Use of **dehumanizing language** to erode constraints on violence

## Iran's Influence

	- Fundamentalist interpretation of faith, imposition of Islamic **law** (sharia)
		- Goals
			- Export the Islamic Revolution throughout the world
			- Resist and limit Western influence
- Violence & coercion -> permitted & necessary means to divinely sanctioned ends: "self-defensive struggle"
- Ideology spread to both Shiite and Sunni extremists
