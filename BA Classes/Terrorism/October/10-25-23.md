# Considerations for Future of Terrorism
- Walter Laquer, Future of Terrorism: "most terrorism threats to the U.S. will likely come from its domestic population"
	- Preventing every attack is impossible -> cost-benefit analysis
- Risk of terrorism and challenge for Western societies?
"The risk of terrorism . . . is not so much that terrorists will destroys a country but that it will cause societies to overreact and see them give up on their values in the name of security, Therefore for Western societies, the seminal challenge is creating an effective and efficient counterterrorism policy that secures their domestic population white at the same time not eroding the very values that define them as such; the rule of law, civil liberties, social pluralism, . . ."

# Anti-Terrorism vs Counter-Terrorism

## Responses to Terrorism
- Anti-Terrorism
	- Defensive element
	- Focuses on
		- Prevention
		- Protection
		- Risk reduction
- Counter-Terrorism
	- Offensive element
	- Focuses on
		- Identification of terrorists
		- Neutralization
	- Mixture of law enforcement & military

## Anti-Terrorism
- Technology = increase in potential targets & weapons available
- Anti-terrorism prevents, protects, and reduces risk -> Security
	- Physical Security
	- Operational Security
	- Personnel Security

#### Physical & Operational Security
- Physical Security: hardening a target against attack
	- More than crime prevention measures - why?
	- Often includes access control, physical & electronic barriers
- Operational Security: deny terrorists opportunity to collect or act
	- Training of personnel: detecting, reporting, responding
	- Avoid recurring patterns of behavior - ex: ITAC route selection
-- "Security Measures: A Frail Defense" In Combs Terrorism in Twenty-First Century

#### Personnel Security
- Combs: training personnel to be responsible for their own security
- Typical US government definition
	- Assessing the conduct, integrity, judgment, loyalty, reliability, and stability of individuals for duties and responsibilities requiring trustworthiness
	- Determine access to sensitive information controlled areas, activates, etc.
- Information Security - also often included in antiterrorism

#### Critical Infrastructure
- Location & system essential to operation of government & economy
	- Physical: airports, seaports, key roads / tunnels, public transportation, utilities, food supply, water, emergency services
	- Digital: telecommunications, internet service providers, servers, **data**
- Challenge: "Bad guys only have to be right once"
	- Balancing enhanced security versus increased costs, decreased convenience, reduced privacy, restriction's on rights, etc
-- A great deal more money is required to erect defenses against terrorist attacks than to commit such acts

#### Threat & Risk Assessment
- What will terrorists do?
	- Keys to assessment: capabilities, intent, history
	- Use various types of indicators to assess the potential threat of terrorism
		- Note: indicators are not predictors
- Risk: What will be lost, damaged, or disrupted by an attack?
	- Risk management
		- Assessment - often quantifiable
		- Evaluation - tends to be subject - based on values

#### Cyberterror and Cybersecurity
- **Cyberterror**: "Unlawful attacks and threats against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives"
