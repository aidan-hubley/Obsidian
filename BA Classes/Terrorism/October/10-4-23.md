#Terrorism
###### Recent Report - "29 Solders killed in Niger by Suspected Jihadist Terrorism" (AFP)
- Occurred during military ops aimed at neutralizing threat posed by Islamic State
	- > 100 terrorists used improvised explosive devices & "kamikaze vehicles"
- Jihadist insurgency has plagued Africa's Sahel region for more than a decade
- "Three borders" area between Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso is regularly the scene of attacks by militants affiliated with the Islamic State group and Al-Qaeda
	- Violence has fueled military takeovers in all 4 countries
		- The average salary after taxes in Niger is $311
-- Why does this matter? --
- Islamic state / Al-Qaeda doesn't operate as a central control, their sub groups / affiliations operate independently
- This area tends to be ignored by West, Jihadists tend to operate in this ignored areas
- This type of violence tends to create migration 

# Religious Terrorism: Al-Qaeda "The Base"
- Grew out of 1980s effort to defeat USSR in Afghanistan
	- Recruited Muslims from around the world to resist Soviet occupation
- Early 1990s: based in Sudan then forced to Afghanistan circa 1996
- Taliban: provided sanctuary, allowed AQ training camps
	- AQ dispersed to various locations late 2001
	- Evolved into truly global network
- Political system: militant Sunni Islamic Jihadists

## Primary Actors
- Osama bin Laden
- Ayman Zawahiri - Egyptian Islamic Jihad
- Affiliated terrorist organizations
- Taliban government in Afghanistan
- Israel & select Arab governments: "near enemy"
- United States: "far enemy"

### Osama bin Laden
- Grew up in Saudi Arabia - son of a billionaire
	- University: met Abdullah Azzam & Muhammad Qutb
- Fought Soviets in Afghanistan - seen as attack on Islam
	- Organized Arab volunteers - created **network** database
- 1989: Returned to Saudi Arabia as a hero
	- 1990: Angered by government reliance on US for protection
- 1991: Moved to Sudan & began **training / funding** Islamic militants

## Causal Factors
- Aftermath of insurgency against USSR in Afghanistan
- Western military presence in Middle East, especially Saudi Arabia
- Cooperation of certain moderate Arab governments w/ the West
- Presence of Israel - status of Palestinians

## Ideology
- Sunni Islamic Jihadists - profound religious ideology (IT, 95)
- 1996: Declaration of War Against the Americans Occupying the **Land of the Two Holy Places**
	- Portrayed Islam as under siege
	- Alleged conspiracy between US & its allies in coordination with UN
- 1998: Jihad Against Jews & Crusaders
	- 5 signatories: Al-Qaeda and **affiliates** in Egypt, Pakistan, and Bangladesh
	- Jihad presented as a universal, individual duty for Muslims (IT, 96)
- Religious terminology to frame conflict - Believers versus Infidels
	- Tailored, targeted propaganda

## Objectives
- All "infidel armies" leave lands of Islam
- Liberate the holy places
- Eliminate enemies of Palestine
- Restore pan-Islamic caliphate & implement sharia (IT, 98)

## Operations, Tactics, Effects
- Major Operations: focused on "far enemy"
	- 1998: bombing of US embassies in Kenya and Tanzania
	- 2000: Attack against USS Cole in Yemen
	- 2001: Attacks World Trade Center, Pentagon, US Capital
- Tactics:
	- Hijackings, suicide attacks, bombings, assassinations
	- Indiscriminate targeting of Americans (IT, 99)
		- Selective targeting of others
- Effects:
	-  More intense acts of violence with significantly more deaths -> true terror

## Achievements & Ethics
- None achieved despite damage done
	- "infidel armies" leave lands of Islam
	- Liberate the holy places
	- Eliminate enemies of Palestine
	- Restore pan-Islamic caliphate & implement sharia
-- Yet Not A Total Failure --

### Ethical Justification
- Deontological approach - divine command
	- "Necessary defense" - justification
- Legitimization of brutal violence
	- High tolerance for deaths of innocents
	- Large numbers and shocking methods
		- 9/11 attacks as well as smaller events, e.g. execution of Daniel Pearl

## Conclusions
- Most important terrorist group ever
- Transformed nature of international terrorism
	- Unprecedented scope and complexity of attacks
	- Radicalization & mobilization of Muslims globally
	- Use of Internet to communicate, recruit, train, equip
	- **Worldwide network of affiliates** - "franchising"
	- Evolution of localized, relatively autonomous cells
