#Terrorism
###### Recent Report - "The Next Pandemic Could Start with a Terrorist Attack"
- "Dual-Use Dilemma" - research intended for good can also be harmful (either intentionally or accidentally)
- Many examples of researchers synthesizing toxins using only publicly available materials and info: poliovirus, horsepox, H5N1 bird flu
- "Synthetic biology" not currently governed by international treaties
-- Why Does it Matter / Relate to Terrorism --

#### Terror Attacks within the United States
- Until 1990s, US experienced few major terrorist attacks
- 1993 attack on WTC in NYC
	- Truck bomb, killed 6, created panic, worldwide investigation

# 1995 Oklahoma City Bombing
- 9:02am April 19 1995 / Murrah Federal Office Building
	- Truck bomb: 168 killed, about 700 injured
	- More than 300 nearby buildings damaged or destroyed
	- 2 tons ammonium nitrate fertilizer and fuel oil
- Deadliest act of terrorism on US soil until  9/11
	- Deadliest act of **domestic** terrorism ever in US

## 1995 Oklahoma City
- Initial suspects list: Middle Easter Terrorists
- Quick shift to Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols
	- Former US Army soldiers - "lone wolf" profile
	- Loose links to extreme right-wing, militant "Patriot movement"
- McVeigh arrested 90 minutes after bombing by State trooper
	- Missing license plate, concealed weapon
-- Why was the initial effort focused on Middle Eastern terrorists? --

## Why?
- Motivation: Revenge - anti-government extremism
	- Ruby Ridge, Idaho
	- Branch Davidian compound, Waco, Texas
- McVeigh wanted a facility used by FBI, ATF, DEA (2 of 3)
	- May have also considered an assassination campaign
- McVeigh saw his actions as morally justified

## Aftermath
- Investigation & Punishment
	- McVeigh convicted: 11 counts of murder, conspiracy, using a WMD
		- Executed in 2001
	- Nicholas convicted: conspiracy, 8 counts of involuntary manslaughter
		- Sentenced to life in prison
- Legislation: Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996
	- Purpose: "Deter terrorism, provide justice for victims, provide for an effective death penalty, and for other purposes"

-- Was it ethical to execute McVeigh? --

- Increased attention on extremist right-wing militias: "Indigenous, violent, Christian white supremacist & anti-federalist movement"
	- Public largely rejects such movements
	- Law enforcement cracks down on domestic extremism
- Violence "justified by theological imperative" emerges fully in US
	- American Christian Patriot movement
	- Racial purification, religious redemption, conspiracy theories
