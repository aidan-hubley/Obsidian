###### Ch. 8 Inside Terrorism
- Hoffman talks about attacks being premeditated
- Designed to communicate a message to an audience
	- The Triad of any terrorist event
		- **T**errorist group
		- **G**overnment attempting to be influenced
		- **A**udience, usually the population
- Tactics, targets, weapons used are shaped by message trying to send, shaped by the personalities of key members, etc.
- Targeting tends to be highly selective
	- Except for religious terrorist groups, their targeting tends to be anyone / everyone

###### 2 Recent Reports:
- Israeli soldiers kill 3 Palestinian terror suspects in West Bank
- PA Condemns assassination of 3 Palestinians in occupied West Bank
-- How does this relate to Terrorism? Why does this matter? --
- Talking about the same incident, from 2 perspectives
	- assassinations vs. killings 
	- Social location matters

# The Evolution of Terrorism: 1968-Onward: Modern Revolutionary Terrorist Era (RAF)
- "The nature and character of terrorism demonstrably changed" (IT. 66)

## Red Army Faction: Time, Place, System, Actors
- 1968-1998: West Germany, aka Federal Republic of Germany (demonocracy)
- Actors:
	- RAF: West German left-wing extremists operating internationally
	- West Germany's government, military, and security forces
	- NATO allies, especially the US
	- East Germany, aka German Democratic Republic (communists dictatorship)
### Causal Factors
- Spread of revolutionary ideology in later 1960s: "urban guerrilla"
	- Anti-Imperialist: opposition to West, especially the US in Vietnam
	- Anti-capitalist: due to expanding socio-economic inequality
- US military presence in Germany
- Palestinian cause and PLO efforts
- East German clandestine support
	- Stasi (secret police) providing training, shelter, supplies to RAF
### Terrorist Goals
- Create terrorist vanguard & lead a left-wing revolution
- Expel US military presence from West Germany
	- Defeat American imperialism, "a paper tiger"
- Provoke the West German government
	- Create support among masses
 - Gain international recognition

### Tactics and Operations
- Bank robberies, bombings, arson, kidnappings, assassinations
- Mid-1970s: expanded to **international** targets
	- 1976: joined with **PLO** in hijacking Air France plane
	- 1977: hijacked Lufthansa - demand release of jailed members
- 1980s: anti-NATO attacks w/**Action Direct** (French terrorists)
	- Active Network with other European terrorist groups
- "Armed Propaganda"
- Targets
	- Economics: banks, aircraft, wealthy business leaders
		- 1975 Vienna OPEC conference
	- Military
		- West German & US military bases, pipelines, personnel
	- Civilian: 1984 attack on Berlin nightclub

### Effects of Tactics / Operations
- Attacks & threats disrupted West Germany and NATO
- Gained international publicity
	- Also alienated many Arab governments
- RAF's small size & frequent arrests by West German security forces limited its effectiveness

### Objectives Achieved
- International recognition but ne leftist revolution
- German unification deeply undercut RAF support and
	- Led to US military drawdown in Europe
- West Germany government generally avoided provocation
- 1992: RAF ends terrorist campaign
- 1998: RAF formally disbands


### Ethical & Political Considerations of MRTE
- Ethical Justification?
	- RAF and other left-wing terrorists tended to target selectively
		- especially non-combatants --see Hoffman, pp 243-4, 248
- Political Implications
	- Terrorism's impact crossed international boundaries
	- Terrorist group networking forced cooperation among nations
