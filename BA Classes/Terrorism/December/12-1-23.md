### “National Strategy For Countering Domestic Terrorism” - June 2021

- “_Comprehensive approach to addressing the threat while safeguarding bedrock American civil rights and liberties”_
	- Focus on addressing violence and factors that lead to violence
- Domestic terror not new: KKK, Oklahoma City, other incidents
	- Yet, “_domestic terrorism is both persistent and evolving_”
- Wide range of violent ideological motivations and forms
	- Lone actors, small groups, networks, violent militias
- Strategy’s Four Pillars
	- Understand and share info regarding domestic terror threats
	- Prevent domestic terrorists from recruiting, inciting, mobilizing
	- Deter and disrupt domestic terror activity before it causes violence
	- Address long-term issues contributing to domestic terrorism

- Challenge: _“DVE attacks often radicalize independently by consuming violent extremist material online and mobilize without direction from a violent extremist organization, making detection and disruption difficult.”
- Strategy focuses specifically on unlawful violence that poses a threat to public safety, to national security, and to free expression of idea
- Commits to “focus specifically on violence and factors which contribute to it while respecting civil rights, civil liberties, and privacy protections”
	- “Violence and its incitement, however, are generally neither tolerated nor protected; indeed, violence is generally criminal, as are incitement to imminent violence and true threats of violence.”

  

### US CT Responses - Brian Jenkins, Rand _“Countering Domestic Terrorism May Require Rethinking U.S. Intelligence Strategy_

- Since 9/11, jihadists in the US killed a total of 105
	- 49 in single incident - Orlando nightclub
- Key to campaign against homegrown jihadists: intelligence
	- Patriot Act: provision of “material support” to a terrorist group
		- No equivalent exists for domestic violent extremists (DVE)
	- _Campaign against homegrown jihadist is not the model for dealing with domestic violent extremists_
- Unlike jihadists, domestic political extremists have a potential constituency
	- US political division could constrain intelligence operations
- Could mean that what constitutes “reasonable suspicion” may be pushed higher - just joining an organization is not enough
- Brian Jenkins: _“challenge is to isolate and contain violent extremists without turning them into political martyrs or half the country into enemies of the state”_
- Legal campaign against domestic extremism is not an assault on beliefs, nor a crusade to root out antigovernment sentiments or to end racism
- Mere links to a hate group will not be sufficient
	- Prosecutors will have to prove participation in criminal act or prep for
- Prosecutors may want to focus on the violent crime, not beliefs behind it
	- _“While intelligence could be a critical component of America’s CT strategy, there are reasons that it may also be wise to return to a more traditional approach that focuses on investigating violent crimes and bringing perpetrators to justice.”_
