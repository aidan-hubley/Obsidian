# Indoctrination and Religious Manipulation: The Lord's Resistance Army (LRA)

## Causal Factors
- 1986
	- Military Government overthrown, Museveni comes to power
	- In the subsequent chaos Alice Lakwena beings Holy Spirit Movement
- 1987
	- Kony Forms beginnings of LRA
	- Democratic Peoples Christian Army forms as an offshoot of Lakwena Holy Spirit movement
- Mid-90s
	- Attacks Grow
	- Begin to receive aid from Sudanese governments
- 2008
	- Height of LRA power, Beginning of Foreign involvement
	- Violence and abductions increase

## Joseph Kony
- Son of subsistence farmers, born 1961 in Northern Uganda
- Supposed cousin of Lakwena
	- Learned to be a healer and spirit medium
- First led United Salvation Army
	- Democratic Peoples Christian Army -> Lord's Resistance Army (1992)
- Grand narratives around personal power

## Stats
- 1987-2012
- >2000 estimated max strength
- 60,000 - 100,000 youth abducted
- 2.5 Million people displaced

"Some men aren't looking for anything logical, like money. They can't be bought, bullied, reasoned, or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn."

- Estimated death: 100,000 

## How did this happen? Why?
1. Cen in Acholi Culture
	- Harmful spirits of those killed violently
	- leaders seek to show immunity from Cen
2. Religious Framework
	- Witchcraft
	- Rules and Taboos
3. Fear
	- Forced killings
	- Language control
	- Silence and isolation

"While the abductees fear such pollution, those commanding the kill  evidently do not. Violating a taboo against killing is a particularly powerful gesture, indicating that the perpetrator has a powerful spiritual alliance, since he fears no repercussions. Here, Kony's spirit is on the side of the killers, seemingly more powerful than anything the abductees have encountered before."

## Tactics
- Methods
	- Insurgency
		- Before 1995 LRA targeted mostly military hard targets
	- Abductions
		- Primary means of sourcing members
	- Indoctrination
		- Coercive radicalization
	- Massacres
		- Violence as "purification" systematic and targeted

## Global Response
- International Outcry
	- Leading to a large, coordinated response
- Unsuccessful Peace Negotiations
	- Displeasure over ICC warrants
- Arrest, Defection, or Death of Major Leaders
	- Capture of Dominic Ongwen
- Regional Instability
	- Different Agendas, Different Narratives

## Ethics and Implications
- Deontology
	- Cult-of-personality features
- Subversive
	- Describing the height against an oppressive, irreligious, and evil regime


## Objectives achieved?
- Hard to say
- Assassinating President Musevini - no
- . . .
