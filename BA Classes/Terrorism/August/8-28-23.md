# "Universal" Ethics
- Frameworks designed to apply to all people
- Emphasis for most is on making good decisions
	- Focus differs on where & how good is achieved
		- Actions: emphasis on the means -- intentions are key
		- Outcomes: emphasis on the means -- results are key
		- Actions: emphasis on the community -- well-being is key
. . .
## Consequential Ethics - Least harm to all parties involved
- Various forms - all emphasize the **Right Outcomes**
- Differing versions based upon scope: universal - group - individual
- Jeremy Bentham: "greatest happiness principle"
	- Believed in ability to calculate the morality of any decision
		- Approach relying on math, science, and economics
		- Pleasure as a measurable commodity
	- Assumed ability to predict events & outcomes with great confidence
- Best known -- Utilitarianism (John Stuart Mill, author of On Liberty)
	- Greatest happiness of the greatest number, and
		- Ensure the least harm is done to all parties involved
	- Happiness = pleasure & absence of pain
		- Unhappiness = pain & deprivation of pleasure
	- Seemingly impartial yet emphasis on higher, intellectual pleasure
- Criticism of consequentialism: opens foor for moral relativism
### **Principle of Double Effect**
- Cannot simply say doing something terrible justifies earning something good
- Difference in promoting good (where no one is harmed) and killing someone to achieve good
- AKA: The action itself must be good or at least indifferent (cannot hurt someone)
- The good outcome must not be the bad effect

## Deontological Ethics - Duty Based
- Emphasis on **Right Action** over Outcome
	- Duty (deon) based on rules or principles or rights > laws
- Various forms - differ based upon the source of the obligation
	- **Divine Command**: decreed by a higher power
		- Emphasis on sovereignty of God / gods
		- Assumes ability to discern will of God (or other higher power)
	- **Natural Law**: external realities impose or reveal moral obligations
		- Thomas Aquinas - high confidence in human nature and reason
		- Key principle: "good is to be done & pursued, evil is to be avoided"
	- **Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative
		- Universal, moral rationalism
		- More law lies within us - the right intention determines duty
		- Individual good will rightly motived leads to right actions
			- Defines what is good in terms of what is more
		- **Formula of Humanity**: always used as end, never merely as a means
			- Deep impact upon Christian ethics
		- Criticisms of Deontology?
					  - Class Suggestions
					    - Contrasting Higher Power Beliefs 
					    - Doesn't acknowledge 'fallen nature'
		 - Right Relationships - Hegel, Marx, Papal...
					
## Virtue - Character based
- Traced back to Socrates, Plato, and especially **Aristotle** - emphasis on **Agents**
	- The intended life is one of Virtue determined by reason
- Emphasis on Character ("moral fiber") as the foundation for right action
	- Developed through virtues: wisdom, courage, temperance -> justice
	- Focuses on being a good person in right relationships
	- Strong association with Christianity
		- Augustine defined virtue as "rightly ordered love"
- Takes time, education, practice, and opportunity to form character -> habits
- Challenging to measure

## Relativism
- Asserts that no ethical framework is better or worse than others
	- Ex: differing approaches to dealing with the dead
- Allows for different truths by different people a different times
- Reflects Nature - no good or bad
- Aligns with many post-modernist beliefs
- Criticisms?
		- Could argue that any action could be good
		- Never have right to be upset or disagree
