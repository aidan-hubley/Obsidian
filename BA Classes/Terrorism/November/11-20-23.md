# Aryan Nations
## The Term Aryan
- The us of the term "Aryan" comes from colonization of the Middle East, where European people wanted the distinction between themselves and the . . .

## The Beginning of the Aryan Nations
- Richard Butler after WWII 
- After he felt that God wanted him spread this message and began having a study group
- Turned to white power meetings

## Ideology and Goals
- All white 5 state group
- Participating in Congress, later realized they needed to part from the American government
- NO non-white Christians in the area
- Spread ideology and have white Christians buy land

## Key Operations and Tactics
- spread ideology by affiliating with other members of white-supremacy groups and publicly appraise them when they would commit acts, the FBI believes that he was funding them or giving them ideas
- Members of the group would put out rhetoric that would be inflammatory and explicit in nature
- Members would attempt mass murder on several occasions
- Staged a coup on the American government, failed

## Effects of Key Operations and Tactics
- His support for other white supremacy groups led to the expansion of his congregation and created a network for him
- The rhetoric spread by the members and his correspondence with prisoners expanded the congregation, but also gained them media attention
- A member killed a Korean man, and stated he would not have killed him if he were white
- More murder near the land, federal seizure of his property and for him to go bankrupt from fines in the early 2000s which would lead to the dissolution of the AWC in 2007

## Objectives Achieved
- To spread the word of God, working for awhile until negative media attention
- Influenced the uprising of Aryan Brotherhood, which is still an active prison gang today. His influences also spread to modern Neo-Nazi groups

## Ethics
- Deontology
	- Necessary racial cleansing to spread word of God. Believed God made white Christians more important 
	- Believed white people were under attack
	- Idea that Jewish people were trying to wash over the Christian faith and that they needed to make the presence of Jesus Christ known to all
- Consequentialism
	- The idea that eventually the area would grow larger and more white and Christian over time would have the effect of racial and religious cleansing

## Conclusion
- Richard Butler wanted the alliance, congregation, and supremacy of White-Christians, and he would hold sermons on his acreage to this congregations
- His sermons created an ideological group that would go on to commit various hate crimes in the Pacific-Northwest
- His ideology spread to other hate groups and influenced the formation of the Aryan Brotherhood and various Neo-Nazi groups that are still active today
- The dissolution of Aryan Nations was not the end of this ideology, but a martyr for other white supremacy groups
