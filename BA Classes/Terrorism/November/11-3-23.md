# Counter Terrorism Policy: A Participant's Point of View
###### Personal Background . . .

## US Military history: The roots of Counter Terrorism capability 
###### Iran Rescue mission: Operation Eagle Claw 24-25 April 1980 - Disaster
###### Post Eagle Claw: Holloway Commission August 1980:
- Recommends that
	- A Counterterrorist Joint Task Force (CTJTF) be established as a field agency of the Joint Chiefs of Staff with permanently assigned staff personnel and certain assigned forces
	- First fully established US Military organization with a CT Mission and authorities

## Focus on comparing pre-9/11 with post 9/11 Counter Terrorist operations
#### Counter Terrorist Operations Pre 9/11
- British Special Air Service rescues hostages taken by Iranian separatist terrorists in Iranian Embassy to the UK, Prince's Gate, London, April 30 - May 5, 1980
- Peruvian Special Forces rescue hostages taken by MRTA terrorists in Japanese Embassy to Peru, Lima Peru, December, 17 1996 - April 22, 1997

#### Enemy Characteristics of Pre 9/11 CT OPS
- Enemy
	- Well defined, geographically contained enemy force
	- Lightly armed enemy, not large numbers
	- Political demands which constrain their actions
	- Desire was for attention to their cause, not producing casualties 

#### Military Characteristic of Pre 9/11 CT OPS
- Reactive in nature (based on a terrorist activity, usually hostage taking)
- Short in nature (ie hours, not months or years)
- Defined, contained objective area (building, ship)
- Well defined success criteria
- Main challenges were:
	- Entry into barricaded objective
	- Identifying Terrorists amongst noncombatants
	- Selectively eliminating terrorists while simultaneously not harming hostages 
	- Speed of operations to prevent terrorists from killing hostages
- Often conducted in view of public and press
- Role of intelligence minimal

#### Methodology of Pre 9/11 CT OPS
- Sequential phased response after "fire alarm rings"
	- Position force to area of operations
	- Control local area
	- . . . 

#### Pre 9/11 CT OPS Organizational Challenges
- Worldwide response posture
- Small deployable force package with robust CT capabilities (Main Effort)
- No requirement for long term sustainability or basing
- . . . 

## Post 9/11 transformation of Counter Terrorist methodologies
#### Enemy Characteristics of Post 9/11 CT OPS
- Poorly defined, geographically dispersed enemy force, located within civilian populace
- Variety of light and heavy weapons, numbers not always known
- Political and religious demands which enable / justify their actions
- Well trains, well equipped

#### Main Characteristic of Post 9/11 CT OPS
- Pre-emptive in nature (based on disrupting terrorist activity)
- Long in nature (generational fight)
- Dispersed objective area
- Success Criteria not well defined
- Generally, not conducted in view of public 

#### Post 9/11 CT Methodology
- Find
- Fix
- Finish
- Exploit - Main Effort
- Analyze - Main Effort
- Disseminate
- Repeat

#### Counter Terrorism Organizational Challenges Post 9/11
- The National CT Forces was organized, equipped, and trained for pre 9/11 type operations but needed post 9/11 capabilities and methodologies
	- Main effort was assault elements; how to sustain forces over long terms?
	- . . . 
- Main Effort shifted to intelligence
	- Terrorists are easy to capture / kill, but hard to find . . . end even harder to understand and unravel their organizations, which are constantly morphing and adapting
	- **"It takes a network to defeat a network"**

## Key Questions
- How was the nature of terrorism changed since 9/11
- How have these changes impacted the nature of Counter Terrorism?
