## Counter Terrorism Case Study: France vs FLN
- French military response: institutionalized torture
	- French won Battle of Algiers - eventually forced FLN shift to bases outside of Algeria
	- Alienated large segments of Muslims & international community

### Battle of Algiers: Victory or Loss?
- France's tactical success -> strategic failure
	- Focused world opinion on Algeria
	- Mobilized support for FLN
	- Heavily divided French public opinion
- French Government continued Repression in Algeria
	- Shifted to Negotiations in final years of conflict
	- Eventual result: granted independence to Algeria

### Effects & Ethical/Moral Assessment
- FLN terrorist operations / tactics - ethical or not? Why?
-- Consequential Ethics / Subversive Ethics --
- French Counter Terrorism operations / tactics - ethical or not? Why
-- Moral High Ground --
- Cycle of violence led to gross ethical violations by both sides
	- FLN bombing civilian targets - women & children (Abane, IT, 60)
	- French military's rampant use of torture (Horne, 203-7)
- Use of violence easily escalates into a downward spiral

# Reminder: 6 Ways Terrorism Ends
- Decapitation
	- Killing or capturing leader
- Negotiation
	- Transition to legitimate political process
- Success
	- Achieving objectives
- Failure
	- Implosion, backlash, marginalization
- Repression
	- Defeating movement by force
- Reorientation
	- Transition to another mode of opns

# Alternative Paradigms
- "Beyond the War Paradigm: What history Tells Us About How Terror Campaigns End" by Jennifer Walkup Jayes, Costs of War
	- Prior to 9/11, US used law enforcement approach to terrorism
		- Post 9/11 shift to military approach for Counter Terrorism -> significant costs
	- Studies show government violence broadens support for terrorist groups
		- Alternatives needed to the "war paradigm" when facing terrorism
- Need Counter Terrorism models to address terrorism's root causes

1. Coercive
2. Proactive
3. Persuasive
4. Defensive
5. Long-Term
- Each model has a different approach
- Tools differ in each - as do pros/cons
- Mixture often used simultaneously
- Claims terrorist groups end most often through Politicization (43%) & Policing (40%)
