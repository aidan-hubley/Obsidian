# Authorization for use of Military Force (AUMF)
- Constitution gives Congress power to declare war (Art 1, Sec 8)
	- 1973 War Powers Resolution: President must report to Congress within 48 hours any situation in which U.S. forces are introduced into "hostilities"
- AUMF passed by Congress shortly 9/11 attacks, **still in effect**
- Many see 2001 AUMF as Congress conceding authority to President
	- Since 2001, all four administrations have referenced 2001 AUMF in reporting to Congress on U.S. military operations in 22 countries
- 2002: Congress passed another AUMF authorizing President Bush to invade Iraq
	- Executive branch has referenced 2002 AUMF to authorize combat and airstrikes against militants in Iraq and Syria

## Use of the 2001 AUMF (2001-2021)
- 22 countries
- At least 6 terrorist groups
- Airstrikes
- Combat Ops
- Detention
- Support

## "Support for Counterterrorism Partners"
- AUMF has been used to support partner nations in Counter Terrorism
- Title 10 also authorizes US military to train / assist foreign military
	- Not intended for training that requires use of hostile force
	- Section127e: allows ops to plan / control missions of others
		- US military allegedly uses this authority to employ foreign military units as surrogates in operations against extremists

## US Counterterrorism Operations, 2018-2020 (Costs of War, Project, Brown University)
- Operations explicitly justified by government using counterterrorism language
- Includes operations by Defense, State, Homeland Security, and other agencies
	- Air / Drone Strikes: 7
	- US Troops or Surrogates in Combat: 12
	- Military Exercises: 41
	- CT Training / Assistance: 79
- Focus on ME, Africa, S/SE Asia, South America

## Cronin - "How Al-Qaida Ends"
- Written in 2009 - AQ was still a huge threat, UBL still alive
	- Radicalization of young Muslims seemed unstoppable
	- Assessed AQ as "unique" among terrorist groups due to:
		- Resilient Structure
		- Methods of radicalization
		- Means of support
		- Means of communication

### Application of the "6 Ways" Framework
- Decapitation: killing Bin Laden wouldn't end Al-Qaida
- Negotiations with core leadership would be "pointless"
	- But conditions may exists to approach & peel off groups in network
- Success in achieving its core objectives unlikely for AQ
- Implosion: Significant potential to exploit AQ's internal fault lines and diminish public support
- Repression: no reason to believe force will end AQ
- Reorientation: to criminality or insurgency partially under way


# Discussion:
- What do you see as successes in US efforts since 9/11 to defeat terrorism?
- What have been failures or shortfalls?
	- Domestic increased security measures
	- Wiki leaks show we've gone far beyond counterterrorism, overreach
	- Invasion of privacy - Snowden leak
	- Withdrawal from Afghanistan 
	- Money spent, a lot 
- Are you ethically comfortable with the US government's approach countering terrorism overseas?
	- Mildly uncomfortable
	- What would you do / have done differently?
		- Overreach + surveillance state
