## Domestic Violent Extremism
- **Domestic Violent Extremist (DVE)**: "an individual based and operating primarily within the United States or its territories **without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group or other foreign power who seeks to further political or social goals wholly or in part through unlawful acts of force or violence**."
- Important Caveat: "The mere advocacy of political or social positions, political activism, use of strong rhetoric, or generalized philosophic embrace of violent tactics may not constitute extremism, and may be constitutionally protected."
