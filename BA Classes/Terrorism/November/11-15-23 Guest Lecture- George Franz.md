# Cyber Terrorism
- What is it?
	- In law, the closed definition is "acts of terrorism transcending national boundaries" and reference to activities and damages defined in the Computer Fraud and Abyst Act. Interestingly, the CFA's discussion of the "punishment for an offense" entails fines or imprisonment and suggests that it is a criminal act as opposed to an act of terrorism
- Legal analyses define cyber terrorism as
	- "The permitted use of disruptive activities, or the threat thereof, against computers and / or networks, with the intention to cause harm or further social, ideological, religious, political, or similar objectives, or to intimidate any person in furtherance of such objectives"
	- This definition aligns with the Patriot Act and the CFA
- Defense analyst Dorothy Denning defines cyber terrorism as
	- "Unlawful attacks and threats of attack against computers, networks, and the information stored therein when done to intimidate or coerce a government or its people in furtherance of political or social objectives"
- Related terms include "cyber attack" and "cyberwarfare". Cyberattack is a recent term that refers to activities conducted through information and communications technology, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Cyberwarfare is considered to be state-on-state action that is the equipment to an armed attack or the use of force in cyberspace that triggers a military response
