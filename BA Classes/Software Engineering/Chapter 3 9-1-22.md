# Agility and Process
## What is Agility
- Quick to respond and accommodate the rapid change
- Encourages teams structures and communication
- Emphasizes rapid delivery of operational software
- Adopts the customer as a part of the development team
- Recognizes that panning in an uncertain world has its limits and that a project plan must be flexible
## Agility and the Cost of Change
- Conventional Wisdom - cost of change increases nonlinearly as a project progresses (solid black curve)
- Relatively easy to accommodate a change when a software team is gathering requirements (early in a project)
- Well-designed agile process "flattens" the curve
## What is an Agile Process?
- Addresses a number of key assumptions
	- It is difficult to predict in advance which software requirements will persist and which will change. It is equally difficult to predict how customer priorities will change as the project proceeds
	- It is difficult to predict how much design is necessary before construction is used to prove the design
	- Analysis, design, construction, and testing are not as predictable (from a planning point of view) as we might like
