1. Aglie Methodologies consist of the Crystal family of methodologies, Adaptive Software Development, Scrum, Feature Driven Development, and eXtreme Programming.
2. The first phase was undisciplined, called the era of developer-as-artist, where developers were seen as geniuses and artists. This phase was marked by a lack of documentation and development tools and by a high degree of dependence on the developer for the continued ongoing operation of the system he or she had created. The second phase was called the era of developer-as-engineer. Principles from engineering, such as factoring and decomposition as well as prototyping were applied to the systems development process. This engineering-based view spawned the structured analysis and structured design approaches. The third phase was ___________________________
3. Instead of systems requirements being produced in analysis, system specifications being created in design, and coding and testing being done at the beginning of implementation, current practice combines all of these activities into a single anaylsis-design-code-test process. These activities are the heart of systems development. This combination of activities started with rapid application development (RAD), and is seen in many of the Aglie Methodologies.Â 
4. One approach to the problem of limited user involvement is to involve the users continually throughout the entire analysis and design process. Such an approach works best when development can follow the analysis-design-code-test cycle favored by the Aglive development methodologies, as the user can provide information on requirements and then watch and evaluate as those requirements are designed, coded, and tested. This iterative process can continue through several cycles until most of the major functionality of the system has been developed.
5. Continual user involvement in systems development is an excellent way to ensure that requirements are capurated accurately and are immediately implemented in system design. However, such constant interaction works best when the development team is small. It is not always possible to have continual access to users for the duration of a development project.

So Aglie developers have come up with other means for effectively involving users in the requirements determination process. One such method is called Aglie Usage-Centered Design, a process with eight steps:

1. Gather a group of people, including analysts, users, programmers, and testing staff, and sequester them in a room to collaborate on the design. Include a facilitator who knows this process.

2. Give everyone a chance to vent about the current system and to talk about the features everyone wants in the new system. Record all of the complaints and suggestions for change on whiteboards or flip charts for everyone to see.

3. Determine what the most important user roles would be. Determine who will be using the system and what their goals are for using the system. Record all of the complaints and suggestions for change on whiteboards or flip charts for everyone to see.

4. Determine what tasks user roles will have to complete in order to achieve their goals. Write these down on 3 x 5 cards. Order tasks by importance and then by frequency. Place the cards together based on how similar the tasks are to each other. Patton calls this a task model.

5. Task cards will be clumped together on the table based on their similarity. Each clump of cards is called on interaction context.

6. For each task in the interaction context, write a description of the task directly on the task card. List the steps that are necessary to complete the task. Keep the description conversational to make them easy to read. Simplify.

7. Treat each clump as a tentative set of tasks to be supported by a single aspect of the user interface, such as a screen, page, or dialog, and create a paper-and-pencil prototype for the part of interface. Show the basic size and placement of the screen component.

8. Take on a user role and step through each task in the interaction context as modeled in the paper-and-pencil prototype. Make sure the user role can achieve its goals by using the prototype. Refine the prototype accordingly.
