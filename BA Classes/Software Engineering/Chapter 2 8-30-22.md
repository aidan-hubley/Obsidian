# Process Models
## Generic Process Framework
1. Communication
	1. Before any technical work can commence, it is critically important to communicate and collaborate with the customer
2. Planning 
	1. Defines the software engineering work by describing the technical tasks to be conducted, the risks that are likely, the resources that will be required, the work products to be produced, and a work schedule. MAP
3. Modeling
	1. Create models to better understand software requirements and the design that will archive those requirements
4. Construction
	1. This activity combines code generation (either manual or automated) and the testing that is required to uncover errors in the code
5. Deployment
	1. The software (as a complete entity or as a partially completed increment) is delivered to the customer who . . . continue on Canvas

## Process Flow
- Linear Process Flow
	- A linear process flow executes each of the five framework activities in sequence, beginning with communication and culminating with deployment
- Iterative Process Flow
	- An iterative process flow repeats one or more of the activities before proceeding to the next
- Evolutionary Process Flow
	- Executes the activities in a "circular" manner. Each circuit through the five activities leas to a more complete version of the software
- Parallel Process 
	- executes one or more activities in parallel with other activities (e.g. modeling for one aspect of the software might be executed in parallel with construction of another aspect of the software)

## Prescriptive Process Models
Define a **predefines set or process elements** and a **predictable process workflow**
- The Waterfall Model
	- Linear Sequential Model
		- Sometimes called the classic life cycle model
	- Problems
		- Real projects rarely follow the sequential flow that the model proposes
		- It is often difficult for the customer to state all requirements explicitly
		- The customer must have patience because a working version of the programs will not be available until late in the project time span
		- Major blunders may not be detectable until the working program is reviewed
- Prototyping Process Model
	- Often a customer defines a set of general objectives for software, but does not identify detailed requirements for functions and features
	- The prototyping paradigm assists you and other stakeholders to better understand what is to be built when requirements are fuzzy
	- Problems
		- Stakeholders see what appears to be a working version of the software. They may be unaware that the prototype architecture (program structure) is also evolving. This means that the developer may no have considered the overall software quality or long-term maintainability
		- As a software engineer, you may be tempted to make implementation compromises to get prototype....
- Evolutionary Process Model
	- Software, like all complex
	- Spiral Model
		- Blend between prototyping and iterative
		- Potential for rapid development of increasingly more complete versions of the software
		- Early iterations, the release might be a model or prototype
