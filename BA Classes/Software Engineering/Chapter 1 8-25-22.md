# Software
1. Single important technology on the world stage
2. Prime example of the law of unintended consequence
3. Software's importance has grown
4. Continually attempt to develop technologies that will make it 
	1. Easier
	2. Faster
	3. Less expensive to build
5. Technologies targeted towards
	1. Application domain (website design and implementation)
	2. Technology domain (object-oriented systems)
	3. Still others are broad based (OS such as Linux)
6. Building software to meet challenges of the 21st century, recognize a few simple realities
	1. A concerted effort should be made to understand the problem before a software solution is developed
	2. Design has become a pivotal activity
	3. Software should exhibit high quality
	4. Software should be maintainable

*Software in all its forms and across all its applications domain should be **ENGINEERED***

## What is a Software?
1. Essentially a product
2. Also a vehicle to deliver a product
3. Delivers the most important product of our time - information
4. New challenges software security

## Failure Curve for Hardware
1. Bathtub curve
2. High failure rates early in its life

## Failure Curve for Software
1. Failure rate for software should take the form of idealized curve
2. Undiscovered defects will cause high failure rates early in life of a program
3. Errors are corrected and the curve flattens
4. With the change - likely introduce new error

## Reflect
1. Hardware components wears out - it is replaced by a spare part
2. There are no software spare parts
3. Every software failure indicates an error in design and the maintenance tasks will be complex

# Software Application Domains
1. Systems software (Compilers, editors, operating systems, drivers)
2. Application Software (standalone programs, etc.)
3. Engineering / Scientific software (number-crunchers)
4. Embedded Software (Keypad controls for microwave oven, washing machine, etc.)
5. Product-line software

# Defining Software Engineering
1. The application of a systematic, disciplines, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software, that is, the application of engineering to software

# Software Engineering is a Layered Technology
1. A quality focus
	1. The bedrock
2. Process
	1. Foundation layer that defines a framework for effective delivery of software technology
3. Methods
	1. Provide the technical how-to for building software. 
4. Tools
	1. Provide automated or semi-automated support for the process....

# The Process Framework
1. Communication
2. Planning
3. Modeling
4. Construction
5. Deployment

# Software Engineering Practice
1. Problem Solving
	1. Understand Problem
	2. Plan a solution
	3. Carry out the plan 
	4. Examine the result for accuracy
