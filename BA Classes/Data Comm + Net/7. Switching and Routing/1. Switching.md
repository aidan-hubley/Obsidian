## Switch Features

A switch is a communication device that connects other network devices.

-   Switches receive and forward data to a specified destination within a local area network (LAN).
-   Switches store MAC address tables that include the MAC address and port for each device connected to it.
-   Switches are full-duplex devices, meaning they can send and receive data simultaneously.

The following table describes unmanaged and managed switches.

Ethernet specifications allow a maximum distance of 100 meters between a switch and its endpoints. The following options can help you meet this requirement:

-   Employ multiple switches throughout a building.
-   Install wiring closets.
    -   Place an access level switch in a wiring closet to connect a system that is configured for VLANs, port security, and voice over IP.
    -   Deploy multiple switches that are connected to a faster upstream switch.

Often, the connections between the upstream switch and access switches are fiber optic.

Advantages of fiber optic over Ethernet cables:

-   Support greater cable lengths than Ethernet over twisted pair.
-   Are much faster than Ethernet twisted-pair connections.

There are two types of switches, Layer 2 and Layer 3.

## Device Connection

A managed switch must be configured before it can be used. The following table describes the two types of management connections.
