The key terms for this section include:
|Term|Defintion|
|-|-|
|Light-emitting diode (LED)|A light-emitting diode is a two-lead semiconductor light source that emits visible light when an electric current passes through it.|
|Wavelength division multiplexing (WDM)|WDM joins several light wavelengths (colors) onto a single strand of fiber by using different wavelengths of laser light.

# Fiber Optic Facts
To connect computers using fiber optic cables, you need two fiber strands. One strand transmits signals; the other strand receives signals. Long-haul runs sometimes need only one fiber. The send and receive signals are transmitted over the same fiber.

## Fiber Optic Components
Fiber optic cabling uses the following components:

-   The _core_ carries the signal. It is made of glass or plastic.
-   The _cladding_ maintains the signal in the center of the core as the cable bends.
-   The _sheathing_ protects the cladding and the core.

Advantages and Disadvantages

Fiber optic cabling offers the following advantages and disadvantages:
|Advantages|Disadvantages|
|-|-|
|Advantages of fiber optic cable include:<br><br>-   Immune to electromagnetic interference (EMI).<br>-   Highly resistant to eavesdropping.<br>-   Supports extremely high data transmission rates.<br>-   Allows long cable distances without a repeater.|Disadvantages of fiber optic cable include:<br><br>-   Is very expensive to install.<br>-   Is difficult to work with.<br>-   Requires special training to attach connectors to cables.

## Multi-Mode vs. Single-Mode
Multi-mode and single-mode fiber cables are not interchangeable. The following table describes multi-mode and single-mode fiber cables.

|Type|Description|
|-|-|
|Single-Mode|Characteristics of single-mode cables include:<br><br>-   Data transfers through the core using a single light path.<br>-   The core diameter is approximately 8 - 10.5 microns.<br>-   Cable lengths can extend a great distance.<br>-   There is less modal dispersion, so bandwidths can be higher.<br>-   Higher-cost electronics are required to send signals down a single path.<br>-   It is optimized for 1310 nanometer (nm) and 1550 nm light sources.
|Multi-Mode|Characteristics of multi-mode cables include:<br><br>-   Data transfers through the core using multiple light paths.<br>-   The core diameter is approximately 50 to 100 microns.<br>-   There is more modal dispersion due to the multiple paths.<br>-   Cable lengths are limited in distance and are dependent on bandwidth.<br>-   Higher light gathering capacity simplifies connections and allows lower-cost electronics.<br>-   It is optimized for 850 nm and 1300 nm light sources.

Additional Tips

Adding connectors onto a fiber optic cable takes some practice. For long cables running between floors or overhead, you might hire an experienced contractor to install the cable and the necessary connectors. Remember to complete the following when installing fiber optic.

-   Keep the area as clean as possible.
-   Cut the cable with a clean 90-degree cut.
-   Polish the end of the cable prior to adding the connector. Use special polishing film and tools for polishing the cable ends.
-   Glue or crimp the connector onto the cable.
-   Cover or cap any connectors that won't be hooked up immediately.
-   If necessary, directly splice two cable ends together. This requires expensive and specialized equipment.

## Fiber Optic Cable Facts

There are two light source technologies prevalent in fiber optic communications, diode laser and high-radiance light-emitting diode (LED). The light produced by these technologies is in the infrared region of the light spectrum.

-   The most common wavelengths used in fiber optics are 850 nm, 1300 nm, 1310 nm and 1550 nm.
    -   In glass, these longer wavelengths have lower attenuation or signal loss due to scattering.
    -   Attenuation in glass due to light absorption for these wavelength is almost zero.
-   Multi-mode fiber is designed to operate at 850 nm and 1300 nm.
-   Single-mode fiber is optimized for 1310 nm and 1550 nm.

## Wavelength-Division Multiplexing

WDM joins several light wavelengths (colors) onto a single strand of fiber.

-   This enables light signals in both directions across a single fiber.
-   Today's systems can easily multiplex 160 signals.
-   WDM is mostly used by long-haul and high-speed providers.
-   Most WDM systems are designed to be used with single-mode fiber.

## Media Converters

When working with fiber optic cabling, you can use media converters to switch between different network media.

For example, you can convert:

-   Single-mode fiber to copper Ethernet wiring.
-   Multi-mode fiber to copper Ethernet wiring.
-   Single-mode or multi-mode fiber to coaxial wiring.
-   Single-mode fiber to multi-mode fiber.
