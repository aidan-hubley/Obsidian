# Physical Network Topology Troubleshooting Facts
## Troubleshoot Network Issues Using Topologies
When troubleshooting physical problems, it helps to identify the fault domain. The _fault domain_ is a group of components that have a single point of failure.

The fault domain often becomes clear when you identify the boundary between communicating devices. For example, if a cable break occurs, a host might be able to communicate with some devices, but not others. When you identify the fault domain, you identify the boundaries of communication and the most probable location of the physical problem.

The following table compares how a single break in the network affects device-to-device communication for specific topologies.

# Link Status Troubleshooting Facts
If a single device is unable to communicate on the network, begin troubleshooting by verifying the physical network connection. Most network cards include link and status lights that can help you verify physical connectivity. The following troubleshooting table describes various light combinations and their meanings.

> Because collisions are associated with hub-based Ethernet networks, modern switches do not typically include a collision light.
