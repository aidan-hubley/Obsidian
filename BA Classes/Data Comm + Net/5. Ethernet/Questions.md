# 5.3 Questions
1. You have a network that's connected using a physical bus topology. One of the cables that connects a workstation to the bus breaks. Which of the following BEST describes the effect that this will have on network communications?
	1. No devices will be able to communicate
2. You have just connected four new computer systems to an Ethernet switch using spare patch cables. After the installation, only three systems are able to access the network. You verify all client network settings and replace the network card in the failed system. The client is still unable to access the network. Which of the following might you suspect is the real cause of the problem?
	1. Failed patch cable
3. You are moving a client to a new location within an Ethernet network. Previous to the move, the client system did not have difficulty accessing the network. During the relocation, you attach patch cables from the client system to the wall jack and from the patch panel to the switch. Once connected, you do not get a link light on the network card or the switch. You swap out the cable running between the patch panel and the switch with a known good one, but you still cannot connect. Which of the following might you suspect is the problem?
	1. Failed patch cable between the client system and the wall jack
4. You have a network that's connected using a full physical mesh topology. The link between Device A and Device B is broken. Which of the following BEST describes the effect that this will have on network communications?
	1. Device A will be able to communicate with all other devices.

7. You are implementing a SOHO network for a local business. The ISP has already installed and connected a cable modem for the business.

	The business has four computers that need to communicate with each other and the internet. The ISP's cable modem has only one RJ45 port. You need to set up the network within the following parameters:
	
	-   You must spend as little money as possible.
	-   You must not purchase unnecessary equipment.
	-   Computers need to have a gigabit connection to the network.
	-   New devices should not require management or configuration.
