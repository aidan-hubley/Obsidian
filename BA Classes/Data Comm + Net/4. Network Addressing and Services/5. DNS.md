# DNS Facts
On all networks, including the internet, computers use IP addresses to identify each other and specify where data should go. It is much easier for users to use hostnames instead of IP addresses. The domain name system (DNS) is used to translate hostnames to IP addresses. This is what makes using the internet so easy.

## DNS Structure
DNS is a hierarchical naming system. Hierarchical means that the system is organized with a root level at the top and everything branches out from that.

A fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is a domain name that spells out each level of the hierarchy. For example, www.testout.com. is a FQDN. The following table describes each section of the FQDN.
