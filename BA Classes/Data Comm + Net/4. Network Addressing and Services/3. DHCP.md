# 4.3 DHCP
- The key terms, for this section include:
|Term|Defintion|
|-|-|
|IP range|The range of IP addresses that the DHCP server can assign
|Subnet mask|The structure of an IP address that defines the network ID and host ID
|Exclusions|IP addresses that the DHCP server will not assign
|Reservations|Static IP addresses that are not dynamically assigned by the DHCP server
|DHCP lease time| The specified amount of time that an IP configuration assigned by DHCP is valid. It is specified when a device is assigned an IP configuration.
|Default gateway| The gateway where data packets that are leaving the network should go to be routed.

## DHCP Facts
For a device to communicate on a network, the device must have its IP information configured. This can be done either manually or dynamically (automatically).

-   A _static IP_ is an IP address that has been manually configured. This means the address will not change even if the device disconnects from the network.
-   A _dynamic IP_ is an IP address that is automatically assigned. The IP configuration is handled by the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP).

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Role of DHCP
-   Configuring DHCP
-   DHCP process

## Role of DHCP
Implementing DHCP on a network allows the IP configuration to be assigned automatically when a device connects to the network. The IP configuration can include:

-   Unique IP address.
-   Subnet mask.
-   Default gateway.
-   Domain Name System (DNS) server (only if needed).
-   Windows Naming Service (WINS) server (only if needed).

## Configuring DHCP
To implement DHCP, the DHCP scope must be defined. This is the configuration information that will be applied to each device receiving an IP configuration though DHCP.

Depending on the network, different devices can serve as the DHCP server such as:

-   SOHO router
-   Windows or Linux server

The following table describes each of the options that need to be defined in a DHCP scope:

## DHCP Process
When a new device connects to the network, it goes through a four-step process to obtain the IP configuration from the DHCP server. The four steps in the process are: discover, offer, request, and acknowledge. The acronym DORA is a useful memory aid. The following table describes the DORA process.
|DHCP Process|Description|
|-|-|
|DHCP discover (D)|The client begins by sending a DHCP discover frame to identify DHCP servers on the network.
|DHCP offer (O)|A DHCP server that receives a discover request from a client responds with a DHCP offer advertisement that contains an available IP address.  If more than one DHCP server responds with an offer, the client usually responds to the first offer that it receives.
|DHCP request (R)|The client accepts the offered address by sending a DHCP request back to the DHCP server.  If multiple offers were sent, the DHCP request message from the client also informs the other DHCP servers that their offers were not accepted and that they can make the IP address in the offers available to other clients.
|DHCP ACK (A)|The DHCP server whose offer was accepted responds to the request by sending a DHCP ACK (acknowledgement). At this point, the IP address is leased to and configured on the DHCP client.
The DHCP renewal process occurs when there is fifty percent remaining on the device's lease time. This process skips the DHCP discover and DHCP offer steps. The client sends the DHCP request packet to the server which responds with the DHCP Ack packet and renews the IP configuration.

When the client attempts to renews its lease, the DHCP server will try to reassign the same IP information. However, if the client is off the network for an extended period and the lease expires, that address goes back into the pool and can be reassigned to another device.
