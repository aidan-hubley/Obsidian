# NTP Facts
The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is designed to maintain accurate and consistent time across a network. It is a critical component of all networks. Without NTP running and properly configured, a network would encounter problems and errors due to inconsistencies in the time.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   NTP basics
-   NTP uses
-   NTP installation
-   Configuring NTP as a time source

## NTP Basics

NTP:

-   Runs over UDP port 123.
-   Is configured on a server that is synced with an authoritative time source such as an atomic clock or a GPS time source.
-   Is very efficient. Only one packet per minute is necessary to synchronize two machines to an accuracy of within a millisecond of one another.
-   Uses Coordinated Universal time (UTC) instead of time zones. Each device is responsible for converting the time to the local time zone.
-   Implements public NTP servers that can be used by individual users or small networks to automatically update computer clocks.

The use of multiple NTP servers is organized using stratum levels.

-   The higher the stratum number, the lower it is in the stratum hierarchy and the less precedence it has in relation to other time providers with a lower number.
-   Stratum 0 is the highest level in the hierarchy. Stratum 0 is the authoritative time device itself, such as a GPS time source or atomic clock.
-   Stratum 1 is the server connected to the authoritative time device.
-   Stratum 2 providers synchronize time from stratum 1 providers.
-   Stratum 3 providers synchronize time from stratum 2 providers, and so on until the stratum level of 15 is reached (the maximum allowed).

Network hosts that are configured to use the NTP protocol to synchronize time function in the following roles:

-   An NTP time provider provides time to clients.
-   An NTP time client seeks time from a time provider.
-   A host can be an NTP time provider and an NTP time client at the same time, receiving time from one host while providing time to another host.
-   An NTP client can be configured to synchronize time from any NTP time provider. Several NTP configurations are commonly used:
    -   In client/server mode, you can configure all NTP clients on the network to synchronize time with a public NTP source on the internet.
    -   You can configure one internal host to be a master NTP time provider. It synchronizes time with a public time provider on the internet, creating an internal authoritative time source. You configure all other NTP clients on the network to get time from this host.
    -   If the network is isolated from the internet, you can configure a master NTP time provider on one internal host to get time from its own internal clock. This creates an internal authoritative time source. All other NTP clients are configured to get time from this host.

## NTP Uses
NTP has many uses across a network. Maintaining accurate time is critical for many functions including:

-   Event logging - Event logs should be sent to a central server where they can be easily viewed. Using NTP to tag each event with the same UTC time stamp is critical in establishing the order of events for troubleshooting and assigning priority.
-   Time mismatch errors - There are some instances where a program will not function properly if the time is wrong.
    -   Program and operating system updates can fail due to time mismatch.
    -   Security certificates will suspect malicious behavior and block connections, if the computer time is off.

NTP also reduces the risk of time drift. Time drift is when a system’s clock begins to get off by a few seconds or minutes. The two methods NTP can use to deal with time drift are:

-   Slew method - If the time is off by only a few seconds, NTP adjusts the time a few milliseconds at a time to get it back on track. Slewing is a slower, methodical method of correcting the time, but the risk of problems occurring are much less.
-   Slam method - If the time is off by more than a few seconds and slewing will take too long, NTP will hard reset the time. While this is a quick and immediate fix, slamming can cause some programs to not function properly.  
    

Some other terms associated with NTP are:

-   _Skew_ measures the difference (in hertz) between the actual frequency of a clock and its frequency to keep more accurate time.
-   _Dispersion_ measures how scattered the time offsets (in seconds) are from a given time server.
-   _Drift_ measures how quickly the skew of a clock changes (in Hertz per second).
-   _Jitter_ refers to small, rapid variations in a system clock.

## NTP Installation
NTP can be installed on various platforms using a variety of methods and tools. The following table lists a few methods and tools to consider:
