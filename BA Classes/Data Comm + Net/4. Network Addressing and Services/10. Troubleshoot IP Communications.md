## Ping Troubleshooting Process

Identifying the scope of a problem is a critical step in the troubleshooting process. To help you understand the troubleshooting process, consider the following reported connectivity problem.

Workstation A (on the local network) can't communicate with Workstation C.![[Pasted image 20221104000354.jpg]]
The following table lists tasks to troubleshoot the reported connectivity problem. These steps trace the problem backward from the remote host to the local host. Depending on the situation, you might be able to troubleshoot the problem more efficiently by skipping some tasks or changing the order that you perform them. You might even complete them in reverse order. You are workstation A.
#### Ping host C
Often, the best way to start troubleshooting a problem is to ping the host you are trying to contact. This verifies the reported problem. If the ping is successful, the problem is not related to network connectivity. In that case, check other problems, such as name resolution or service access.

> If you have access to another computer, try pinging the destination host from that computer. If the ping is successful, skip the remaining tasks and troubleshoot the local host configuration or physical connection.

#### Ping host D
If you cannot contact a specific remote host, try pinging another host in the same remote network. If the ping is successful, the problem is with the remote host. For example, the problem could be a misconfiguration, broken link, or unavailable host.

#### Ping host E
If you cannot contact any host in the remote network, try pinging hosts on other remote networks (try several other networks). If the pings are successful or if you can contact some remote networks and not others, the problem is with the routing path between your network and the specific remote network.  
  
Use the tracert (Windows) or traceroute (Mac) commands to check the path to the problem network.

#### Ping the default gateway
If you cannot contact any remote network, ping the default gateway router. If the ping is successful but you still cannot contact any remote host, have the router administrator verify the router configuration. Check for:

-   Broken links to the remote network.
-   Interfaces that have been shut down.
-   Access control lists or other controls that might be blocking traffic.

#### Ping host B
If you cannot contact the default gateway router, ping other hosts on the local network. If the pings are successful, check the default gateway router.

#### Troubleshoot the local host connection or configuration
If you cannot communicate with any host on the local network, the problem is likely with the local host or its connection to the network. Troubleshoot by doing the following:

-   Check physical connectivity.
-   Validate the TCP/IP configuration on the local host.
-   Validate IP configuration settings.

The route command can be useful in troubleshooting. You can use the route command on the router to view directly connected routes that have been set up. You can also use it on the default gateway of the local subnet to verify that the router has a route to the remote subnet. Additionally, you can use the route command to:

-   View the routing table; this helps you see the networks the router knows about.
-   Display additional networking information not provided by ifconfig.

One special ping test you can perform is pinging the local host. By doing this, you are verifying that TCP/IP is correctly installed and configured on the local host. You are verifying the workstation can communicate with itself.

To ping the local host, use the following command:

> **ping 127.0.0.1**

If this test fails, check to make sure TCP/IP is correctly configured on the system.

> This test does not check physical connectivity. The ping can succeed even if the host is disconnected from the network.

## Gather Network Connection Information

The following table lists several commands that you can use on a Windows system to gather information about network connections.
![[Pasted image 20221104000604.png]]
Local computers have a cache of recently used IP addresses and their corresponding MAC addresses. When a computer needs to contact another computer on its own subnet, it first checks its cache for an entry of the IP address. If the entry is found, the corresponding MAC address is used to communicate with the destination computer.

> The cache can cause problems if the MAC address for a computer has recently changed (such as the network interface card has been replaced). To correct a problem, use the **netsh** command to clear the ARP cache.


1.  Use the **ping** and **ipconfig** commands to troubleshoot network issues.
    1.  Right-click **Start** and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
    2.  At the PowerShell prompt, type **ping 192.168.0.30** and press **Enter** to ping Office1.  
        You can successfully ping the IP address of Office1 from ITAdmin.
    3.  Type **ping 199.92.0.33** and press **Enter** to ping Support.  
        You can't ping Support from ITAdmin. Notice that the IP address for Support is on a different network (network 199.92.0.0 instead of network 192.168.0.0). Devices on the same local network must have IP addresses in the same network range. If you want to communicate with Support, you will need to change the IP address assigned to Support.
    4.  Type **ping 192.168.0.5** and press **Enter** to ping the router's internal interface.  
        You can successfully ping the router's internal interface from ITAdmin because ITAdmin and the router's address (192.168.0.5) are on the same network.
    5.  Type **ipconfig** and then press **Enter** to view the IP settings.  
        Notice that there is no default gateway assigned.
    6.  Type **ping 163.128.78.93** and press **Enter** to ping the external DNS Server.  
        ITAdmin and the ISP are on a different network (network 192.168.0.0 and 163.128.78.0, respectively). Because ITAdmin does not have a default gateway set, it can't communicate with devices on other networks.
2.  Use the **tracert** command to see how network packets are forwarded.
    1.  From the top left, select **Floor 1 Overview**.
    2.  Under Executive Office, select **Exec**.
    3.  Right-click **Start** and then select **Windows PowerShell (Admin)**.
    4.  At the PowerShell prompt, type **tracert 198.28.56.1** and press **Enter**.  
        When you communicate with devices on other networks, the packets go to the default gateway first (the router between the two networks). The packets are sent to the router interface on the same network as the sending host and then to the next hop in the path. In this case, there are two IP addresses listed in the tracert output, but only one router (hop) between Exec and the internet router. The last address in the tracert output is the internet router.
    5.  Enter **tracert 163.128.78.93** and press **Enter** to trace the path to one of the ISP's DNS servers.  
        When you trace the path between Exec and the ISP's DNS server, the path has additional hops. The first lines in the **tracert** output are the routers (hops) between Exec and the DNS server. The last address in the **tracert** output is the DNS server.
