#NetworkSecurity [[17. Cryptography]]
- Remote Access Server
	- Assumptions
		- Single Device
	- M&M Philosophy
- RADIUS Server
	- Microsoft's Solution
	- UDP
		- Good for a live event, cannot resend
- TACACS+
	- CISCO Solution
	- TCP
		- More Reliable - has an acknowledgement number
		- Can resend (unlike UDP)

# Protocols
- What is a protocol?
	- An agreement between computers, how to understand a bunch of bits
- Why?
	- Requires communication, a shared understanding of rules
- What happens if things fail?

## Point to Point Protocol (PPP)
- Layer 2 (and a half)
- PPPoE
- Password Authentication Protocol (PAP)
	- Password is sent in the clear
	- Can use SSL or IPSEC to secure
- CHAP
	- Can continuously authenticate
	- MS-CJAP uses mutual authentication
- EAP
	- Protocol to negotiate authentication
	- Used in Wi-Fi and 802.1X

# LDAP (Lightweight Directory Protocol)
- Protocol for Exchanging Directories
- Assumes a tree structure
	- Requires a root node
- Open and non-proprietary

# LDAP Authentication
- Users are anonymous by default
- Can be bound (bind) to a suer account
- Simple Authentication and Security Layer
	- Works with Kerberos or TLS
- LDAPS uses the SSL/TLS to encrypt the communication
- Single Sign on
- LDAP is usually ground truth (compared to SAML)

# Biometrics
- What you are
- Thumbprint - FaceID- Iris
- Enrollment - Process of scanning face or finger, etc
- Risks:
	- False positive
		- Comes back positive it should be negative
	- False negative
		- Comes back negative it should be positivite
	- Drift - People change over time, weight, wearing a mask, etc
