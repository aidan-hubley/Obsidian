# Electronic Warfare
## Assume anything you broadcast is heard by adversary
- Link Budgets
- Passive vs. Active
	- Passive (receiving only)
	- Active (transmitting)
- SSID Detection
- Interference (EMI)
- Channel Overlap
- Jamming vs. Deauthorization Attack
- Disassociation Attack

# Unauthorized Access Points
- Rogue Access Point
	- Unplanned access point on network
	- Have no security set up, will bypass all security 
- Evil Twin
	- Duplicate Access Point
	- All traffic is visible to the Evil Twin (for Man in the Middle)
- Defense
	- Sniffers (Look for unauthorized access point)

# Non-Wi-Fi Attacks
- Bluejacking
	- High jacking blue tooth signals
- Blue Snarfing
	- Want a device to appear as something else
	- Make my malicious laptop appear as if it's airpods
- RFID Monitoring
- RFID Cloning
- RFID Man in the Middle
- NFC (Near Field Communication) Attacks

# WEP (Initialization Vector Attack)
- WEP is a Shared Symmetric Key
- WEP has a known header
- IV Value
	- 26 bits
	- Makes the Shared Kay look different
	- Must be sent in plain text
	- Some IV values when combined with the key make it easy to find the key

# Wireless Crypto Analysis
- Aircrack - cracks WEP and WPA keys
- airmon - Puts card into monitor mode
- airdump - Packet Sniffer
- Airdecap - Decrypts packets with key
- Originally developed for WEP
- Added WPA Dictionary Attacks
