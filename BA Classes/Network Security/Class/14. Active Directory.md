## Standalone Mode 
- Every uses their own stuff

## Workgroup Mode (Peer to Peer)
- Some resources are shared
- Accounts and Authorizations are local
- Peers must trust each other
- Rarely used

## Domain Mode (Client Server Mode)
- Server manages Accounts and Authorizations
- Centralized Control
- Expensive and needs planning

## Online (Cloud)
- Hybrid of standalone and domain
- Microsoft acts as a domain controller, but usually uses standalone machines

# Active Directory vs. Domain Controller
- DC is a server that authenticates and authorizes access to the domain
- AD is a database that organizes and tracks resources
- Domain Controllers run (or serves) the Active Directory
- Active Directory can be replicated on multiple DC's
- AD tracks Objects and can group them into OU's
