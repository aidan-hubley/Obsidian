- Discretionary vs. Mandatory Labeling
	- The owner of the file has discretion to view anyone access

|Method|Unique|
|-|-|
|Mandatory Access Control|Subjects and Objects must be labeled|
|Discretionary Access Control|Objects are owned by a subject who can choose who to grant access
|Role Based Access Control|Subjects are grouped into roles - More sustainable
|Attribute Based Access Control|Uses Boolean Logic to determine if access is granted
|Dynamic Based Access Control|Miscrosoft's new model in 2012. Uses elements of all the above. Can automatically label your data. Integrates well with Active Directory and the File System
