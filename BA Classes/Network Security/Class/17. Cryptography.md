#NetworkSecurity [[18. Steganography]]
# Transposition Cipher
- Scytale - leather strap with a bunch of letter on it 
	- Gets wrapped around a wooden staff to align letters in a specific way

# Substitution Cipher
- Caesar Cipher
- Key = 3
- Break it by looking for common letters

# Crypto In Transition
- Vigenere Cipher
	- Multi-shifting cipher, essentially what Caesar Cipher^2

# Crypto In Transition
- Enigma device
	- New Key, every letter
	- Impossible to crack unless you start in the right position
- Bombe device to try and crack Enigma
- Allen Turning

# Perfect Cryptography
- One Time Pad
	- Uses a code book, has a bunch of random numbers / letters that form the key
- How do they work electrically?

# XOR and Cryptography
- Logical Operation
- VERY fast
- Reversible
- Relationship with Stream Cyphers
- Entropy and Cryptography
- Pseudo-Random Numbers

# AES 
- Block Cypher
- Combines substitution and transposition
- Successor to 3DES
-  Loads of Matric operation

# RSA Algorithm
- The Key Distribution Problem
- Diffie Helmen
- Two Keys
- Key Mathematical Assumptions
	- Factoring is slow
	- Multiplication is fast

# Public Key Crypto
- To Encrypt
	- c = m ^ e mod n
		- m = message
		- c = cipher text
		- e = public key exponent
		- n = public key modulus
- To Decrypt
	- m = c ^ d mod n
		- m = message
		- c = cipher text
		- d = private key exponent
		- n = private key modulus

# Using Asymmetric Keys to Encrypt
- Alice
	- Public Key
	- Private Key
- Eve (Attacker)
- Bob
	- Public Key
	- Private Key
- Alice send Public Key
	- Everyone sees it
- Bob uses the public key to send message
	- Eve can't decrypt it 
- Alice decrypts it with her Private Key

- NEVER gives private key

# Hash
- Mathematical function 
- Converts data to fixed sized block
- Small challenge in the results in a large change in the digest
- MD-5 and SHA-2
- DropBox
	- Connects accounts > Hashes > Files
	- Used to give access to any account through hash
- Collisions
- Birthday Attack

# #Certificates
- Certificate of Identity
- This is signed, but not by owner
	- Signed by Certificate Authority

# Hybrid Encryption
- Start with async
- Bob creates a 'hybrid' / 'session' key
- Very fast
