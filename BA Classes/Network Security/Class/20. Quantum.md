#NetworkSecurity [[21. Certificates]]
- Combinatorial Explosion
- Quantum partials have different possible states
- Feynman wanted to calculate which state a system could be in to achieve a specific result
- Grows **incredible** rapidly

# Traveling Salesman Problem
- Really really hard problem

# The Double Slit Experiment
- Fun but doesn't make sense

# Quantum Bit - Qubit
Bit = 1 or 0
Qubit = both, can be simultaneously both 1 and 0, until its not 

# Quantum Entanglement 
- Uhhh what?

# Low Energy Optimization
- Metronomes seek the lowest energy state
	- board om soda cans experiment
	- Fish in a school
- Same for Quantum Computing - they automatically seek the lowest energy state

# Protein Folding

# Cryptography
Finally, familiarity
- Quantum computing would automatic the computing race for new nonces 
- Instance money, until it crashes
