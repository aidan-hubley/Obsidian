- Positive Air Pressure
	- Your air pressure inside is greater than pressure outside
	- Air gets pushed into walls and insulations
- Negative Air Pressure
	- When indoor air pressure is lower than pressure outside
	- Outside air rushes in to try and balance the pressure


# UPS (Uninterrupted Power Supply) and Backup Generators
