#NetworkSecurity [[5. Physical Security and Utilities]]
**Physical Access Makes Hacking Easy**
- Avoid direct physical attack (don't allow them to get to the device)
	- Alternate Boot / Reset
		- Factory Reset / Easy mode hacking
	- Console Access (routers specifically)
		- Most Cisco routers have a figuration port, do not let someone get access!
		- Build backdoors, hide incoming traffic, etc.
	- Implants
		- Key logger thumb drive, camera, mics, etc.
		- Physically attach something to the infrastructure
		- Undercover employee
	- Malicious cables
		- Malicious replacement USB-c chips
	- Live, unattended ports
	- Cell phone charging

Man Traps

## Link Budget
- Start with a transmitter
- Energy is focused and sent with an Antenna
	- Energy is amplified to make up for the energy lost distance traveled
- Energy is received by an Antenna
- Caught by a final Receiver

Why do we care?
- Optimal conditions, how far can you receive a Wi-Fi signal
	- 40-50 feet
- No, 60 miles. ?????
- With specialized equipment / an effective antenna, you can pickup signals from much further away than you anticipate
- "You electronic signals might go a lot further than you think."
- "Electromagnetic signals do not respect walls, guards, or borders."

Based on transmission and speed


## Emission Security
Any current, including wires, are antenna

# H.E.M.P
(Not Hemp)
and EMI
- Nuclear Weapon over a City/Region would fire any microchips
- Weapon systems are H.E.M.P hardened 


## Data Destruction
- Electronic devices are getting shockingly hard to destroy
- Shredder is effective for paper, but AI and good camera can hypothetically recreate 


## DMZ and Air Gap
- DMZ Network Architecture
	- DMZ is a part of the network is not a part of your network, but also not a part of the whole internet
	- Web server, Mail server, etc. Stuff other people (outside your network need to touch)
- Air Gap, "I have a system so important that I don't want to connect it to the internet."
	- Private keys, super secure certificate
