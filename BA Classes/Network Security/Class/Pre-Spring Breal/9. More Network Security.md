# Stateless Firewalls
- Stateless - doesn't have memory
- Firewall makes the decision the same without keep tracking of anything before
- Acts as a filter
- Host vs Network firewall
	- Host - on machine
	- Network firewall - on boundary of LAN and DMZ
- Often act as a router
- Only looks at an individual packets (does not need to remember what happened in that connection before)
- Can impact availability (if misconfigured)

# More Advanced Firewalls
- Stateful - (Remembers previous connects)
	- Slower and more resources
	- Port scan protections
		- (remembers if someone scans port 1, then 2, then 3, then 4. will stop them)
	- UDP Floor
	- Echo Storms (Ping Flood)
- Application - Layer 7 Firewalls
	- Proxy filter is a specific kind
	- SQL Injections
	- Cross-Site Scripting

# VPN - Virtual Private Network
- VPN over Wi-Fi
	- Most used over public network (on a Coffee Shop LAN, you should use a VPN)
- SSL vs. TLS
	- SSL is deprecated
	- TLS is newer
- IPSEC
	- Own Protocol
	- IPv4 and IPv6 has a Protocol Header, it can be set to IPSEC
		- Authentication Header
		- Encapsulating Security Payload - Encrypts the packet
- Tunneling
	- A connection through the internet

# Proxies
- Forward
	- From your machine to the internet
	- Privacy - Outside viewer can't see who is using the proxy
	- Can Filter
- Reverse
	- From you on the internet into an online resource
	- Can monitor who is coming in
- Transparent
	- Can be a forward proxy, but do not modify your request 
	- Makes your activity online look as if you aren't using a proxy
	- Similar to Forward
	- Typically Forced
- HTTPS would be a problem without a Proxy

- Block / Permit by exception
	- Management 
	- Content vs. Address
	- Added Time or User filters
- Subscription Service
