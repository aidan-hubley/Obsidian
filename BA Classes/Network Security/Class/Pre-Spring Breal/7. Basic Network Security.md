# Trusted Operating System (TOS)
- _Common Criteria_
	- Created a protection profile and an evaluation criteria
	- How do I know if my operating system is "secure"
	- DACL - Discretionary Access Control List
	- MACL - Mandatory Access Control List
	- _Protection Profile_ - What am I trying to do
	- _EAL Level_ - How sure am I
	- Independent Evaluator - expensive
	- Examples
		- Windows 7 rated EAL-4+
		- Mac 10.6 EAL-3+

# Firewalls
![[packet-ipv4.svg]]
- Firewalls are just a filter, they check the header of a packet
- Common:
	- Allow or disallow based on the 
		- Source IP address
		- Destination IP address
		- Source Port
		- Destination Port
	- Often a mix of IP's and Ports that are blocked

# Ports
- 20, 21 - FTP (File Transfer Protocol)
- 22 - SSH (Telnet but encrypted)
- 23 - Telnet
- 25 - SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)
- 53 - DNS (Domain Name Server)
- 80 - HTTP (Web)
- 135-139, 445 Netbios and RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
- 443 - HTTPS (Web but secure, it is encrypted)

- ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol)
	- Used for Ping
- TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)
	- Port 80 protocol
- UDP (User Datagram Protocol)

# Host Based Firewall
- Exists in the software stack
- Limited utility at home (due to NAT)
- Useful in public networks
- Drop vs. Reject

# Windows Permissions
- Use **Groups** not accounts
	- Easier to assign **roles** groups than to accounts
- Role Based Security
- Deny > Allow
	- Denies are more important that allows, deny takes precedence over other allows
- Share vs. NTFS (New Technology File System)
	- Can assign NTFS permissions to individual files
	- Can assign Share permissions to folders
	- When Windows assigns permission on the file system
- Comparison to NIX
	- UNIX - Read, Write (edit, override, delete) , Execute
	- Windows - Read, Write, Delete, Execute
- Inheritance
	- New files automatically inherits the permissions of the folder they are created in

# Useful Commands
- netstat 
	- -a (all) -l (listening), -I (table of interfaces)
- nmap
	- -sT, -sU
- yum
	- install, erase, list installed
- systemctl
	- --type=server --state=active, disable, stop
- iptables
	- input, output, and forwarding chains
