#NetworkSecurity [[20. Quantum]]
# The Satoshi paper
- Published in 2008
- Detailed workable crypto currency 
- "Satoshi Nakamoto" is assumed to be a pseudonym
- He currently owns > 750,000 bitcoins

# The Double-Spend Problem
- Consider a bounced check...
	- I have $100 in my bank
		- I write two checks for $90
		- Whoever gets to my bank first, gets the money
	- Problem is spending the money twice
- The bank needs to get involved to mediate the dispute
- The bank needs to have the power to fix things
- But what is we don't trust the bank?

# A New Financial Model
- We create an open ledger of transactions
- Ledger is distributed
- Participants are anonymous, but the transaction is visible
- Transactions are irreversible
- People **cannot double-spend**
- No **single point of trust** 
- Requires honest nodes to have more computational power than any group of attackers

# Transaction Flow
Alice -> Bob
- Transfer 10 bitcoins to Bob's Public Key
	- + Proof Alice has the funds
- Signed by Alice

Bob -> Doug
- Same transfer, but uses ^ previous transaction history has proof of funds

## Ledger
- Documentation that is used by everyone and is visible to everyone


# Block Chain
- We take a hash of a publicly available post (such as a newspaper publication or usenet post)
- We collect all the items we have received
- We then take a hash of the previous block in the chain and all the items
- We then look for a SHA-256 hash that has some characteristic (such as a required number of zero bits)

## Process
- New transactions are broadcast to all nodes
- Each node collects all transactions into a block
- Each node works on finding a difficult proof of work for it's block
- When a node finds a proof of work it broadcasts it to all nodes
- Nodes accept the block only if all transactions are valid and not already spent
- Nodes accept the transaction by ....


# Why?
- Generation Transaction
	- Means, bitcoin solvers award themselves 6.25 bitcoins
- The Genesis Block resulted in a reward of 50 bitcoins
- An attacker must choose between getting legitimately rewarded or trying to out-compete everyone else
- Eventually, block generation could also be funded by a small transaction feel

## Security
- Each block included a reference to the previous one
- The longest block chain is considered the correct one
- To "hack" the system, one needs to generate a longer chain
- This means solving more blocks faster than the honest computers


# Non-Financial Uses of Blockchain
- Proof of ownership
- Internet of Things
- Software Authenticity
- E-Voting
- Licensing / Credentials
- Contracts
- Reputations
