# Security Controls
1.  Identify
2. Project
3. Detect
4. Respond
5. Recover

# Peer 2 Peer Networking
- Designed to avoid control
- Designed for extreme reliability
- Designed to put so much information in so many different areas that you couldn't take it out
- Principle of reciprocity
	- If you are going to use the system you have to share
- It is a tool
	- Terrible reputation because it was used for illegal activity
	- Also used for good:
		- Wiki Leaks
	- Blockchains

# Network Switch
- Used to get all computers talking LOCALLY
- Fast / Private
- Operates at Layer 2 (Data - Link Layer) 
	- (Layer 3 switches are just routers)
- Automatic
- Cheap
- Simple*
	- Can become more complex
- UnManaged
	- No human interventions
- Managed
	- Can configure it to do cool fancy things

# Ethernet Frame Format
![[Pasted image 20230206131757.png]]
- Preamble + Start Frame Delimiter
	- Used to inform machine that a frame is coming
	- No real information in the first 8 bytes
- Destination Address / Source Address
- Length
- Data / Frame Check Sequence
	- Here is the math used to prove no bits flipped

# ARP (Address Resolution Protocol)
- How we associate the Layer 2 Internet Address with the Layer 3 Address

# ARP and Switch
- Need to quickly figure out which port to go to
- Assumption: We will only have a limited number of clients on our switch
- Failure Behavior

- Switches are made cheaply
- Cheap switches only have so much memory
- Assume: Only 50-60 computers on LAN
- Hackers realized that they could broadcast A Lot of ARP messages and eventually fill the ARP table
- When an ARP table is full, it will broadcast to everyone
- Called a MAC Flood

# DCHP
![[Pasted image 20230206133504.png]]
- By default: No authentication
- Designed to be simple
- Hacker: What if my computer responded to the DCHP server quicker than the original client, also becomes the gateway for the client
	- Man in the Middle Attack
- Assumption: Only the legitimate server would answer
- Problem: HTTP is just plain text, If a client inputs info, a hacker can see it
- What if a rogue system answered?

# ARP Cache Spoofing
- Intrinsic Vulnerability - not much you can do about it
- Goal is a Man in the Middle attack
- Attacker sends ARP requests to trick victims
- DHCP snooping and Dynamic ARP Inspection to defeat man in the middle attacks
- Best solution: Encryption

# Managed Switches
- Configure defensive functionality
- Set up a (spam) port to listen to all traffic
- Create a VLAN
- Price to Pay: Password for switch
	- Usually have default passwords
- SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol)

# VLAN's vs. Segmentation
- Breaks up the broadcast domains
- Simulates buying multiple devices
- More flexible
- Example: Isolate VOIP from Computing
- Create new attack surface
