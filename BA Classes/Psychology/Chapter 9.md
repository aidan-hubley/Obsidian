#Psychology
- **Cognition** - Mental processing information (images, concepts, etc); thinking
- **Cognitive Psychology** - is the study of human information processing
	- The basic unit of thoughts are images, concepts, - language 

# Mental Image
- **Image**: picture like mental representations 
- Most of us use images to think, remember, + solve problems
	-  to make a decision, to improve skill, to aid in memory
- **Created Image**: invented rather than remembered 
- **Kinesthetic Image:** Created from produced, remembered, or imaged sensations

# Concept Formation / Issues
- **Concept:** Idea that represents a class or events
- **Concept Formation:** Process of classifying world into meaningful categories
- **Conceptual Rules**: Guidelines for deciding whether objects or events belong to concept class
- **Prototypes**: Ideal model used as an example of a good concept
- **Denotative Meaning**: Exact definition of a word / concept
- **Connotative Meaning**: Emotional / personal meaning of a concept

# Language
- Words / symbols, + roles for combing them, used for thinking and communication
- **Semantics**: Study of meanings in language
	- A given order of words subtly alters the meanings of the last word because words get meaning form context

# Decision: Making + Mental Shortcuts
- **Intuition**: Quick, impulsive thought that doesn't make use of formal reasoning
	- We often use **heuristics** (mental shortcuts) - "rule of thumb" that reduce alternatives that people must consider
	- Human decision making strategies are simplistic + often yield irrational results 
- **Heuristics**: several types of heuristics have been identified by cognitive psychologistic - . . .
- **Confirmation Bias**: A tendency to search for information that confirms a personal bias 
	- Put another way "We see what we want to see"
- **Representativeness Heuristic**: Classifying something as belonging to a category because it is similar to a typical item in that category
- **Base-Rate Fallacy**: Failure to consider probability of given event in total population
- **Availability Heuristic**: Basing an estimate on ease w/ which examples from that category came to mind
	- We tend to over estimate the frequency of vivid, impactful, news worthy events examples: plane crashes
- **Framing**: The way a problem is stated / structured - people take more risks on decisions framed negatively (to recover loses or prevent injuries), then when the same decision is positively framed (to achieve goals)

# IQ / Testing
- **Intelligence:** is the ability to learn from experience, solve problems, and use our knowledge to adapt to new situations
#### Assessing Intelligence
- Standford-Binet Intelligence Scale, Fifth Edition (SB5): Widely used individual intelligence test
##### SB5: Cognitive Factors Measured
- **Fluid Reasoning**: Tests reasoning ability
- **Knowledge**: assesses the person's knowledge about a wide range of topics
- **Quantitative Reasoning**: measure a person's ability to solve problems involving numbers
- **Visual-Spatial Processing**: people who have visual-spatial skills are good at putting picture puzzles together and copying geometric shapes
- **Working Memory**: Measures the ability to use short-term memory


#### Principles of Test Construction
-- For psychological test to be acceptable it must fulfil the following three criteria:
- Standardization
- Reliability
- Validity

###### Standardization - A test involves administering the test to a representative sample of future test takers in order to establish a basic for meaningful comparison

###### Normal Curve - Standardized tests establish a normal distribution of scores on a tested population in a bell-shaped pattern called the normal curve

###### Reliability and Validity
- A test is **reliable** when it yields consistent results
- The **validity** of a test refers to what the test is supposed to measure or predict
-- You can have reliability without validity but you can't have validity without reliability -- (**STAR**)


#### Some Intelligence Quotient (IQ) Terms
- Chorological Age: Person's Age in years
- Mental Age: Average intellectual performance
- Intelligence Quotient (IQ): Intelligence index; mental age divided by chronological age, then multiplied by 100
- Average IQ in the U.S.: 100


#### The Nature and Nurture of Intelligence
- Intelligence is NOT solely a consequence of your genes or solely a consequence of your environment
- We can assess the relative contribution of nature and nurture through twin and adoption studies

###### Nature's Influence on IQ Scores
- The greater the genetic similarity between two individuals, the more similar are their IQ scores
	- This suggests a genetic component to intelligence

###### Nurture's Influence on IQ Scores
- All other things being equal, two individuals raised together will have more similar IQ scores than those raised apart
	- This is evidence that the **environment** shapes intelligence in important ways

- The IQ sources of adopted children correlate more highly with those of their biological relatives than those of their adoptive relatives. Such data point to a probable role of heredity

#### IQ Research Results
- A strong correlation (about .50) exists between IQ and school grades
- IQ is not a good predictor of success in art, music, writing, dramatics, science and leadership
- Giftedness: Having a high IQ (usually above 130) or special talents or abilities
- Men and women do NOT appear to differ in overall intelligence

#### Gender Similarities and Differences
-- There are several ways in which males and females differ in various abilities --
- Girls are better spellers
- Girls are verbally fluent and have large vocabularies
- Girls are better at locating objects
- Girls are more sensitive to touch, taste, and color
- Boys are better at spatial ability and math computation
- Boys mental ability scores also vary more than girls
- Women detect emotions more easily than men do

#### Gardner's Theory of Eight Multiple Intelligence
- Language: Used for thinking by lawyers, writers, comedians
- Logic and Math: Used by scientists, accountants, programmers
- Visual and Spatial Thinking: Used by engineers, inventors, aviators
- Music: Used by composers, musicians, music critics
- Bodily-Kinesthetic Skills: Used by dancers, athletes, surgeons
- Intrapersonal Skills (Self-Knowledge): Used by poets, actors, ministers
- Interpersonal Skills (Social Abilities): Used by psychologists, teachers, politicians
- Naturalistic Skills (Ability to Understand Natural Environment): Used by biologists, organic farmers
