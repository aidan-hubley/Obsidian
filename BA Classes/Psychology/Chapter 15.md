# Therapy
## Psychotherapy - (pp 536-546)
### Behavioral Therapies
- Use of learning principles to make constructive changes in behavior
- Behavior modification: Using any classical or operant conditioning principles to directly change human behavior
	- Deep insight is often not necessary

### Classical Conditioning Techniques
- **Counterconditioning** is a procedure that conditions new responses to stimuli that trigger unwanted behaviors
- It is based on classical conditioning and includes **exposure therapy**, **aversive conditioning**, and **systematic desensitization**

#### Exposure Therapy
- Exposure therapy involves exposing people to fear-driving objects in real or virtual environments
- Through repeated exposures, anxiety lessens because they habituate to the things they feared

#### Aversion Therapy
- Aversion conditioning is repeatedly paring the problematic behavior with an aversive stimulus
- Conditioned Aversion: Learned dislike or negative emotional response to a stimulus
- Rapid Smoking: Prolonged smoking at a rapid pace

#### Systematic Desensitization
- A type of exposure therapy that associates a pleasant, relaxed state with gradually increasing anxiety-triggering stimuli commonly used to treat phobias
- Reciprocal Inhibition: One emotional state is used to block another (e.g. impossible to be anxious and relaxed at the same time)
- **Hierarchy**: Rank-ordered series of steps, amounts, or degrees
- **Vicarious Desensitization**: Reduction in fear that takes place secondhand when a client watches models perform the feared behavior
- **Virtual Reality Exposure**: Presents computerized fear stimuli to patients in a controlled fashion

### Operant Conditioning
- Operant Conditioning procedures enable therapists to use **behavior modification**, where desired behaviors are rewarded and undesired behaviors are either unrewarded or punished 

#### Reinforcement and Token Economies
- **Tokens**: Symbolic rewards like poker chips, gold stars, or stamps that can be exchanged for real rewards
- **Token Economy**: Patients get tokens for many socially desirable or productive behaviors; they can pay tokens for tangible rewards and for undesirable behaviors

# Psychoanalysis
- The first formal psychotherapy to emerge was psychoanalysis, developed by Sigmund Freud
- Problems would arise from unconscious feelings and conflicts
- Goal: the uncovering and resolving of unconscious conflicts

## Methods
- Freud developed the method of free association to unravel the unconscious mind and its conflicts
- The patient lies on a couch and speaks about whatever comes to their mind
- During free association, the patient edits his thoughts, resisting his or her feelings to express emotions. Such **resistance** becomes important in the analysis of conflict-driven anxiety
- Eventually the patient opens up and reveals his or her innermost private thoughts, developing positive or negative feelings (**transference**) towards the therapist

## Modern Psychoanalysis
- Brief Psychodynamic Therapy: Based on psychoanalytic theory but designed to produce insights more quickly
- **Spontaneous Remission**: Improvement of a psychological condition due to time passing **without** therapy
- Waiting-List Control Group: People who receive no therapy as a way to test the effectiveness of psychotherapy

# Cognitive Therapy
- Focuses on changing negative thoughts and beliefs in order to eliminate maladaptive behaviors 
- **Selective Perception**: Perceiving only certain stimuli in a larger group of possibilities
- **Overgeneralization**: Allowing upsetting events to affect unrelated situations
- All-or-Nothing Thinking: Seeing objects and events as absolutely right or wrong, good or bad, and so on

# Humanistic Therapy
- Humanistic therapies - assume that it is possible for people to use their potentials fully and live rich, rewarding lives

## Client-Centered Therapy
- Developed by Carl Rogers, client-centered therapy is a form of humanistic therapy
- The therapist listens to the needs of the patient in an accepting and non-judgmental way, addressing problems in a productive way and building his or her self-esteem

### Four Basic Rogerian Conditions
- **Unconditional Positive Regard**: Unshakable acceptance of another person, regardless of what they tell the therapist or how they feel
- **Empathy**: Ability to feel what another person is feeling; capacity to take another person's point of view
- **Authenticity**: Therapist is to be genuine and honest about his or her feelings
- **Reflections**: Rephrasing or repeating thoughts and feelings of the clients'; helps clients become aware of what they are saying
