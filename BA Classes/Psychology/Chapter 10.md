## Motivation and Hunger
- **Motivation**: Dynamics of behavior that initiate, sustain, direct, and terminate actions
- How do motivated activities work?
	- Need: Internal deficiency, which causes a . . .
	- Drive: Energized motivational state activates a . . .
	- Response: Action to attain a . . .
	- Goal: Target of motivated behavior
- Incentive Value: Goal's appeal beyond its ability to fill a need

## Types of Motives
- **Primary Motive**: Innate (inborn) motives based on biological needs must meet to survive
- **Stimulus Motive**: Innate needs for stimulation and information
- **Secondary Motive**: Based on learned needs, drivers, and goals

## Arousal Theory
- **Arousal Theory**: assumes that people prefer to maintain ideal, or comfortable levels of arousal
- **Arousal**: refers to the overall level of activation of the body and the nervous system
- **Sensation Seeking**: Trait of people who prefer high levels of stimulation
- Most people perform best when their arousal level is moderate
- **Yerkes-Dodson Law**: If a task is simple, it is best for arousal to be high, if it is complex, lower levels of arousal provide for the best performance

## Circadian Rhythms
- **Circadian Rhythms**: Cyclical changes in bodily functions and arousal levels that vary on a 24-hour schedule
- Most noticeable after a major change in time schedules
- If you fly west, adapting takes about 5 days
- If you fly east, adapting takes 50% longer
- Preadaptation: Gradual matching of sleep-waking cycles to a new time schedule before an anticipated circadian rhythm change

## A Hierarchy of Needs
- Abraham Maslow suggested that certain needs have priority over others
- Physiological needs come before psychological need

### Levels
- Self-actualization needs
	- Need to live up to one's fullest and unique potential
- Esteem needs
	- Needs for self-esteem, achievement, competence. and independence; need for recognition and respect from others
- Belongingness and love needs
	- Need to love and be loved, to belong and be accepted; need to avoid loneliness and alienation
- Safety needs
	- Need to feel that the world is organized and predictable; need to feel safe, secure, and stable
- Physiological needs
	- Need to satisfy hunger and thirst

## Types of Motivation
- **Intrinsic Motivation**: Motivation coming from within, not from external rewards; based on personal enjoyment of a task
- **Extrinsic Motivation**: Based on obvious external rewards, obligations, or similar factors (e.g. pay, grades)

# Hunger
## The Physiology of Hunger
- Stomach contractions (pangs) send signals to the brain making us aware of our hunger

## Stomachs Removed
- Tsang (1938) removed rat stomachs, connected the esophagus to the small intestines, and the rats still felt hunger (and ate food)

## Body Chemistry & the Brain
- Levels of glucose in the blood are monitored by receptors (neurons) in the stomach, liver, and intestines
- They send signals to the hypothalamus in the brain

## Hypothalamic Centers
- The **lateral hypothalamic** (LH) brings on hunger (stimulation)
	- Destroy the LH, and the animal has no interest in eating
- The **ventromedial hypothalamus** (VMH) depresses hunger (stimulation)
	- Destroy the VMH, and the animal eats excessively

## Hunger (cont)
- Set Point: point where weight stays the same when you make no effort to gain or lose weight
	- **Leptin**: Substance released by fat cells that inhibits eating

## Eating Disorders
- **Anorexia Nervosa**: A condition in which a normal-weight person continuously loses weight but still feels overweight
- **Bulimia Nervosa**: A disorder characterized by episodes of overeating, usually high-calorie, foods, followed by vomiting, using laxatives, fasting, or excessive exercise.

# Primary Motives Revisited - Thirst and Sex
## Thirst
- **Extracellular Thirst**: (Sweating) When water is lost from fluids surrounding the cells of the body
- **Intracellular Thirst**: (Eating salty foods) When fluid is drawn out of cells because of increased concentration of salts and minerals outside the cell

## Stimulus Drives
- **Sex Drive** - Refers to the strength of one's motivation to engage in sexual behaviors
- **Estrus** - Changes in the sexual drives of animals that create a desire for mating; particularly used to refer to females in heat
- In contrast to females, the normal male animal is almost always ready to mate.

## Emotion
- **Emotion** - State characterized by physiological arousal and changes in facial expressions, gestures, posture, and subjective feelings
- **Adaptive Behaviors**: Aid our attempts to survive and adjust to changing conditions
