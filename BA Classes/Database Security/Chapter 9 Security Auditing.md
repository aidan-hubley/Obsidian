# Database Security - Auditing
- Security audit
	- Purpose: Review an environment's security controls and systems to identify weaknesses
	- Meant to provide an accurate view of organization's security controls
		- To initiate positive changes for weak areas
	- Can be an important security measure in itself

## Conducting Audits
- Frequency Depends on nature of the business
- Audits can be conducted:  
	- Informally as part of an organizationâ€™s yearly self-assessment  
	- After a security intrusion  
	- In reaction to an identified risk  
	- Formally to satisfy industry-specific standards or laws

## Purpose of Audits
- Purpose of audit determines who conducts it
	- Legally Required Audits conducted by a third-party
	- Self-assessment Audits conducted by internal committee

## Goal of an Audit
- Identify security measure's purpose
- Locate any risk on the network that might prevent security measure from achieving its purpose
- Search for process or practice already in place to mitigate the identified risks
- Report any areas in which risks are identified and no mitigation process is in place 

## Process
- Prepare
- Audit
- Report

### Prepare
- Planning and prep
	- Define scope
	- Determine what systems, department, or component of the organization will be included
	- Conduct preliminary interviews to learn about network and business structure
	- List and prioritize assets
	- Identify potential threats
- Priority shifts could cause certain areas to be left unchecked for a time  
	- Defeats the purpose of a proactive security strategy  
- Organization should do little preparation for a security audit  
	- Conduct daily activities in typical form  
- Some organizations prepare extensively for audits  
	- Do not want negative repercussions from audit results  
	- Provides inaccurate view of the typical environment

### Audit
- Audit scope :> Areas or systems on which security audit will focus  
- One of the most important steps  
	- Identify priority assets  
	- Make conceptual perimeter of the security audit  
- Understand network and organizational structure 
	- People, policies, systems, and controls  
	- List tangible and intangible assets  
	- Prioritize assets  
	- Include prior audit reports
- Audit plans  
	- Include logistical details and information already gathered  
	- Include backup strategy and impact to daily operations  
- Nearly impossible to conduct security audit on all areas of the network at the same time  
	- Several small security audits should be scheduled  
	- Schedule may be modified if an elevated risk is identified

### Reporting
- Final step of the process
- Debriefing meeting where results are communicated
	- Usually involves company's owners, senior managers, and other stakeholders
- Vulnerabilities and risks are identified
	- Sometimes strengths as well
- Formal or external audit includes deliverables and time frames for implementing expected actions
- Components
	- Background information  
	- Defined perimeter and scope  
	- Audit objectives  
	- Key findings  
	- Methodology used to identify risks  
	- Remediation recommendations  
	- Specific remediation actions to implement recommendations

# Database Auditing
- Should be conducted frequently and thoroughly to contribute to the security measures
