# Why Database Security?
  
Most databases provide access spanning several  
networks and across the world  
- Most online transactions involve a database  
- Water supplies, electricity grids, and gas and oil production depend on a computer network to thrive  
	- Breach could have disastrous impact  
- Network intruders are well trained and growing more sophisticated

## A Secure Data Environment
- Multiple layers of security - user training, email filter, firewall
- 3 layers of security for secure data storage - database security, computer security, network security
- Database security
	- set of established procedures, standards, policies, and tools 
	- protect against theft, misuse, and attacks
	- deals with permissions and access to the data structure.
- Common vendor features for database security
	- database-level access control
	- database-level authentication
	- data storage encryption
- Computer security
	- Necessary element of database security
	- Typically defined by the operating system
- Common computer security features
	- Operating system-level access control
	- Operating system-level authentication
	- Application security
	- Hardware and software monitors and logs
Network security  
- Outermost layer of the database  
- Arguably biggest security concern  
- Set of established procedures, standards, policies, and tools  
â€“ Goal: protect network from theft, misuse, and attacks  
Hardware and software devices used to secure a network  
- Firewalls, antivirus programs, network monitors, intrusion detections systems, proxy servers, and authentication servers

## Database Security Objectives
Security measures
- Keep information private from outside viewing
- Maintain consistency of data
- Ensure resources remain at a high degree of availability 
Key to achieve effective data security architecture
- Organization must maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of its environment
Confidentiality requirements
- Ensure information remains private by limiting authorized access to resources
- Block unauthorized access to resources
Confidentiality protected using authentication and access  
controls  
- State and federal laws may apply to these measures  
Breaches in confidentiality could result in:  
- Stolen identity  
- Exposed business trade secrets
Integrity  
- Reliable, accurate, and consistent data stored in and retrieved from the database  
- Protected by preventing accidental or deliberate  
modifications  
- Most difficult item to measure  
Auditing used to compare data with older, backed-up versions of the data  
Results of integrity breaches  
- Unreliable data, flawed programs, system failures
Availability  
- Maintaining accessible network or database resources  
- Business cannot operate without it  
Must identify potential threats to availability  
- Assess threat level  
- Plan appropriate intervention  
- Example of threats: technical failures, natural disasters, intrusions, user-caused harm
Must understand what poses a threat
- More threat exist on the inside of a network than on the outside
Overly restrictive database are as ineffective as those that give too much access
- Healthy balance is needed

## Social Engineers
- People who manipulate others to gain access to systems, unauthorized areas, or confidential information
	- Often build trust with authorized user  
	- Use deception and trickery to convince people to break normal security policies  
	- Example: asking for a password

## Computer Users
- Network users cause over half of security breaches
- Major contributing factors
	- Lack of education
	- Disregard of policy
- Examples of most common user errors
	- Poor habits (computers unlocked and unattended)
	- Password error (writing passwords on sticky notes)
	- Disregard for company policy (downloading unauthorized software)
	- Opening unknown e-mail attachments
	- Inappropriate disclosure (giving information over the phone to a social engineer)
	- Procrastination (failing to report computer issues in a timely manner)
- Computer-literate users may take risks and find shortcuts to security measures
- Disgruntled employee on a network can abuse access rights and destroy files

## Network and Database Administrators
- Not often viewed as threats to networks they run
	- Room for error exists
	- Their mistakes have consequences for integrity, availability, and reliability of the network
- Dynamic nature of the data environment
	- Can cause new security flaws to be created
	- Network components must be regularly audited
- Common mistake
	- Not removing a user's rights and account credentials

## The Internet
- Two billion internet users
- 100 million Web sites
- 85% of US residents have Internet access
- Online education and social networking increasing in popularity

- Web browser
	- Application that interfaces client machine to Internet
	- Responsible for sending and receiving user pages
	- Has built-in programming language that can be manipulated
- SQL injection 
	- Intruders append malicious code onto a database-directed URL
	- Intended to manipulate database into sending confidential information
- HTTP portion of Web address informs browser of protocol used to send request for the Web site
	- Can include form-related data appended to URL
- Domain name server (DNS)
	- Database of domain names and their respective IP addresses
- DNS poisoning
	- Cracker gains control over DNS server
	- Cracker substitutes their site IP address for the legitimate domain name IP address
	- User may be fooled into providing personally identifiable information (PII)

## Misleading Application
- Applications designed to deceive users into believing their computer's security has been breached
	- User downloads and purchases fake antivirus tools
	- Tools deliver malware to user's computer
	- User has no knowledge of true security breach

# Security Architecture: Never-Ending Cycle
- Creating a security architecture is not an easy task
- Techniques used to attack database developed using same technology used to protect the systems
	- Intruders become more advanced as technology advances
- New intrusions developed constantly
- Process of creating and maintaining security architecture has four phases

## Phase 1: Assessment and Analysis
- Determining an organization's data security needs
	- Identify existing vulnerabilities, threats, and assets
- Security audit
	- Used to identify threats
	- Can be conducted internally or by a third party
- Determine cost of breached or lost asset
	- Security measures should never exceed value of assets they protect
- Questions to ask to guide this phase are listed on Page 25 of the text 
	- What are the devices and resources with the database environment?
	- What type of threats exist within the database environment?
	- What are the assets that need protection?
	- What value do the assets have?
	- What cost would the threats incur?
	- What is the likelihood that each threat will occur?
	- What level of security is needed for each threat?
- Risk assessment steps
	- List all devices and resources within a database environment
	- Identify vulnerabilities and assets involved with each resource and device
	- Define asset value and cost of damage from the threats
	- Create security measures to counteract the threats
	- Prioritize the security measures

## Phase 2: Design and Modeling
- Create policies and prototype security architecture to fit business needs
- Entire organization should be included in the process
	- Policies must be realistic for user and business needs
- Questions to ask to guide this phase are listed on Page 26 of the text
- Design steps
	- Define needed policies and procedures
	- Identify firmware and software changes to support the policies
	- Create an implementation plan
	- Create baselines to determine success and failure
	- Define a plan for user training and awareness

## Phase 3: Deployment
- Security policies, firmware, and tools put in place
- Test environment usually create first
- Firmware and software purchased and tested
- Questions to guide this phase are listed on Page 26 of the text
	- Have user training adjustments been well accepted?
- Deployment steps
	- Adjust user awareness training as needed
	- Test firmware and software changes in a controlled simulation environment
	- Deploy changes according to the deployment plan

## Phase 4: Management and Support
- Monitor security system performance
- Reevaluate architecture after any failures or breaches
- Questions to guide this phase are listed on Page 27 of the text
- Management and support steps
	- Monitor performance of security architecture and user security awareness and training
	- Make minor policy revisions as necessary
	- Identify need for reassessment and initiate the start of the security life cycle
