# Shell Code
- Code to gain access to some key function (Shell)
- We saw this in Buffer Overflows
- Represented as string of bytes
- We want to execute this code without getting caught

## Ways to hide
- That shell code forms a pattern that is visible
	- We want to change the signature
- Compress the data
- Simple Encryption
- Complex Encryption
- Encoding
- Hide in complex files

## Portable Execution Format
- When a program executes, it has to set up the memory
- Where are the Libraries
- How are they linked
- Images, text, etc.

## Detection Techniques
- Unpacking
- API detection
- Sandboxing

## Stageless
- Code is embedded in the malware file
- Simple
- Easier to detect
- Self Contained
- Exists on a file
- Easier to analyze 

## Staged
- Grans the shellcode from elsewhere 
- More complicated
- Harder to detect
- Requires a network connection
- Shell code exists only in RAM
