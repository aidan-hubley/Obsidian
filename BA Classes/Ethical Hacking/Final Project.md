- Build a VM that is Vulnerable 
	- Operating System
	- Application (Web Server, Mail Server)
	- Dumb Human
- Place a file (named flag.txt) on the VM that you build
- Describe / show how an attacker would identify this vulnerability
- Create an exploit for this vulnerability (can use Metasploit and existing tools)
- Create a connect to the vulnerable machine (Shell, Reverse Shell, etc)
- Grab the flag
- You may work with others, but they must be exploiting a different vulnerability 

## Deliverables
- Give a 5-minute demo of this project - during the final period
- Copy of any files that you created / used for the exploit
- Presentation Materials including
	- Resources and people used
	- . . .
	- How you would improve this

## Notes
- You may work with others, but they must be exploiting a different vulnerability
- Show what you did, not necessarily all of the steps
