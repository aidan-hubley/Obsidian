#EthicalHacking
# OT Systems
- Hacking the Real World

# Idaho National Labs Aurora Generator Test (2007)
- 2.25 MW Diesel Engine Connected to a Generator
- The importance of phase in an electrical system
- Attack opened and closed breakers out of sync with the grid
- Generator tore itself apart in <3 minutes

## SCADA Systems
- Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
- Programmable Logic Controllers
- Older Proprietary Communication Protocols
	- Modbus RTU, RP-570, Profibus, and Conitel

## Security Relevant Differences

|Information Technology|Operational Technology|
|-|-|
|<5 years Tech refresh|Much older, 10/20 year lifespan|
|Patched Frequently|Reluctance to patch|
|Tools / Code Easily Available|Harder to acquire (but there is eBay)|
|Hacking skills highly relevant|Hacking skills plus physical knowledge|
|Lots of defensive tools|Much fewer tools|


## Physical Access
- Air-gapped
- Implants
- Gateways
- Communication is rarely encrypted
- Man in the middle

## CANBUS
- Controller Area Network (CAN bus)
- Used in autos
- Also used in Public transportation, Agricultural, Elevator
- Priority Message Based System

## Havex
- Began in 2010 but discovered in 2013
- Targeted Energy, Aviation, Pharmaceutical, Defense, and Petrochemical sectors in Europe with some American Exposure
- Controlled by Berserk Bear (Believed to be a Russian FSB Controlled Group)
- Three Phases to download Havex Remote Access Trojan:
	- Spear-Phishing (supported by good intelligence) with link to download
	- Redirection of links to legitimate sites
	- Applications infected with link to download legitimate ICS software
- Havex reached out to Berserk Sear servers where they gathered intel about their victims and installed other packages
- Started scanning ports 44818, 102, 502
- Ports mainly used for industrial applications
- Appeared to by mostly intelligence gathering but adding malicious control would have been trivial
- Most victims ran windows XP
	- Out-of-date
	- Proven
	- Reluctance to Revalidate (Pharmaceutical)
- Three companies targeted by Havex were primarily used by the Pharmaceutical companies


## Sandworm
- Believed to be Russian military unit 74455 associated with the GRU
- Several referenced to Arrakis
- Developed a collection of malware tools known as BlackEngery
- Tools were focused on spear-phishing with malicious attachments to hack the computer
- Dec 23, 2015: Coordinated cyber attack against 3 energy companies in Ukraine disrupted power for 230,000 people for 1-6 hours
- Appears to have been down manually from the console

### CrashOverride / Industroyer
- Dec 17, 2016: Power attack eliminates power to 1/5 of Kiev with Industroyer Malware
- Attack was ultimately a failure (but a scary one)
- Backdoor connection to a C2 server using HTTPS
- Trojanized version of notepad to provide a second back door
- Custom port scanner
- Espionage Tool
- Data wiper
- Stateful ICS tool that turned of Power Relays
- Wiper added to hinder recovery

#### Siprotec Attack
- Siemens Siprotec device: Safe guards that can take quick and precise action to guard the grid
- Industroyer place the device into firmware update mode
- Once in that mode, the target device is unresponsive until it is rebooted manually

#### Industroyer 2
- Single windows executable named 108_100.exe
- Scheduled to execute at 4:10pm on 4/8/2022
- Specific to IEC 60870-5-104 Transmission Protocols
- Synchronized with another wiper program targeting Linux systems known as Caddywiper
- Attack gave some indications that allowed alert operations to prevent the damage
