# .NET Reflection
- Reflection lets you look inside a .NET Assembly
- \[System.DateTime].GetMethods() | Select-Object Name

- Someone wrote a function to send data to the Log
- We want to patch our program so the data never gets written (permissions)
- Patch program in memory
- Marshal.copy - Copies data from a managed array to an unmanaged memory pointer, or from an unmanaged memory pointer to a managed array
- What happens when the programs gets called
