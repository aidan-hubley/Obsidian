#DiscreteMath
# Software and Sets
"Discrete math is primarily concerned with mathematical operations on sets, but software developers need to think about HOW to actually represent the set in order to (correctly) satisfy queries to the set of items."
# Sets ∩ ∪ ⊆ ⊄ ⊂ ⊃ ⊇ ⊅ ∈ ∉
1. Much of mathematics is based on the concepts of the set:
	1. Embedded in many fields and definitions
		1. In database query design and processing
		2. Programming languages implement set operations (i.e. union, difference)
		3. Statistical mechanics (Feynman diagrams, thermodynamic ensembles)
## What is a Set?
1. A set is an unordered collection of items
	1. Each item is called an element of the set
	2. Elements are unique; they appear 0 or 1 time
		3. b ∈ S   b is an element of set S
		4. e ∉ S   e is Not an element of set S
	3. A sequence is ordered (and can contain elements more than once)
2. How do we DEFINE a SET?
	1. **Roster notation**
		1. S = {a, c, d, b}
		2. A list of the elements enclosed in curly  braces with the individual elements separated by commas
		3. {} ... order does NOT matter
			1. () ... order Does matter (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 ...)
		4. Use ellipses ... to list elements of inferred pattern {2, 4, 6, ... 100}
	2. **Set Builder notation**
		1. {x: x ∈ S and has some additional properties}
			1. some texts use {x | x  }
			2. set s has already been defined
		2. {n: n is an odd integer, n > 0}   the odd natural numbers
		3. (x ∈ Z: 0 < x < 100)    = 1, 2, 3 .... 99
## Set Notation
1.  **:**   such that
2. **∈**  element of 
3. **∉**  element is not in a set
4. **⊆**  subset of

## Cardinality
1. The numbers of elements in a set
2. Denoted as |S|
	1. For S = {a, b, c, d}, |S| = 4
3. For infinite sets, if a one-to-one (or bijective) correspondence can be shown then cardinality is the same
	1. |C| = |D| for C = {1, 2, 3 ...} and D = {0, 1, -1, 2, -2 ...}
# Set Equality

		1. x ∈ A -> x ∈ B AND x ∈ B -> x ∈ A
# Common Sets
1. R = the set of all real numbers
2. Z = the set of all integers
3. Q = the set of all rational numbers
4. N = Natural or counting numbers
5. 0 = the empty set (sometimes denoted as {}); contains no elements
## Other Sets
1. Positive if x > 0
2. Negative if x < 0
3. Non-negative if x >= 0
4. Non-positive if x <= 0
5. For A = {-1, -2, 0, 3, 5}
# Venn Diagram
1. A pictorial representation of a set (or multiple sets)
2. Use a rectangle to represent Universal set U, which contains every element currently under consideration (often S in probability/statistics)

	2. Sometimes explicitly defined
3. Use an oval shape to denote sets within U
# Subsets
1. T is a subset of S (T ⊆ S)
	1. Ax ((x ∈ T) -> (x ∈ S))
	2. To show T ∉ S, find x ∈ T and x ∉ S
2. Its true that 0 ⊆ S ⊆ U
	1.  (the empty set is a subset of set S which is a subset of universal set U)
## Proper Subsets
1. A set A is said to be a proper subset of B is and only A ⊆ B and A != B. We denote that A is a proper subset of B with the notation A ⊂ B
# Sets of Sets
1. Elements of a set can be sets
	1. A = {1, 2, {1}, {1, 2}}
	2. S = {Ø, {1}, {1, 2}}
	3. Ø is not the same as {Ø}

		2. {Ø} has on element
2. For Set S
	1. S = {Ø, {1}, {1, 2}}
	2. |S| = 3 (the cardinality)
	3. Complete the set
		1. |S| = 3
		2. {1} ∈ S? Yes
		3. {1} ⊆ S? No, because 1 ∉ S
		4. { {1} } ⊆ S? Yes
		5. {Ø, 1} ⊆ S? No, because 1 ∉ S 
		6. {Ø, {1}} ⊆ S? Yes

3. Example: A = {a, b, c}
	1. P(A) = {Ø, {a}, {b}, {c}, {a, b}, {a, c}, {b, c}, {a, b, c}}
	2. |P(A)| = 2^3 = 8
4. Hasse diagram of the partially ordered, complete lattice (P(A), ⊆) and set A = {a, b, c}
	1. lattice diagram in **canvas**
	2. Hasse Diagram:
		1. A point is drawn for each element of the partially ordered set (poset) and joined with the line segment according to the following rules:
			1. if p < q in the poset, then the point corresponding to p appears lower in the drawing than the point corresponding to q
			2. The two points p and q will be joined by line segment if p is related to q
