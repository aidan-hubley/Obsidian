# Functions
1. What is a function?
	1. It maps elements from one set to another set
	2. One element of domain (set) to a unique element in target (set), or co-domain
	3. f: X -> Y means "f is a function from X to Y"
		1. (x, y) ∈ f
		2. f(x) = y
	4. Functions can be mathematical or task-related 
		1. Restaurant diners -> tables
		2. f(x) = x^3 - 4; f:R -> R
	5. Related terms
		1. **Domain, target** (or co-domain) **, range**
			1. Ranges is a subset of target but not necessarily equal to target
				1. Range of f = {y: (x, y) ∈ f, for some x ∈ X}
	6. Defining a function
		1. f is defined by how it acts on input x
			1. f: R -> R where f(x) = x^2 - 3x - 4
		2. Is the function "well-defined"?
			1. Yes, if definition includes domain and target and doesn't include any undefined values
				1. Example: g:R -> R, where g(x) = 1/(x-2) is not defined at x=2
			2. No, if f maps an element of domain...
				1. to nothing
				2. to more than one element of the target
					1. g:R -> R, where g(x) = ±√(x^2 + 1)
## Describe the function
1. How do we describe a function (if finite domain)?
	1. Use an arrow diagram
		1. An arrow exists from x ∈ A to y ∈B iff (x, y) ∈ f
		2. Elements of range have arrows coming to it
	2. A set of ordered pairs
		1. f = {(a,1), (b,4), (c,2), (d,4)}
		2. (this is a subset of A x B)
	3. State the output....
## Sets of Strings
1. The domain set and target set for a function can also be a set of strings
	1. Examples:
		1. f: {0, 1}^3 -> {0, 1}^4 inputs a 3-bit string and outputs a 4-bit string
			1. f(x) = x0 (add zero to 3-bit string)
				1. f(011) = 0110
		2. f: {0, 1}^5 -> {0, 1}^4
			1. f(x) is obtained by removing the last bit
				1. f(01101) = 0110
## Function Equality
1. When are two functions equal?
	1. if domain AND target are same
	2. If outputs of functions are the same for all x in domain... f(x) = g(x)
	3. does f = g?
		1. Domain: (D) = {2, 4, 6, 8}
		2. Target: (T) = Z
		3. f: D -> T, f(x) = x^2 - 7
		4. d: D -> T, g = {(2, -3), (4, 9), (6, 29), (8, 57)}
			1. Yes, f(x) = g(x)
			2. Domain and target are same; outputs are equal
# 4.2 Floor and Ceiling Functions
1. What is a floor function? ceiling function?
	1. For any integer, floor/ceiling is same integer
	2. Maps REAL NUMBERS to nearby INTEGER R(real) -> Z(integers)
		1. Floor function: maps downward
			1. Floor (x) = [x]
			2. Largest Integer that is <= x
			3. Example: 
				1. [5.2] = 5    
				2. [-5.2] = -6
		2. Ceiling Function: maps upward
			1. Ceil (x) = [x]
			2. Smallest Integer that is >= x
			3. Example:
				1. [5.2] = 6
				2. [-5.2] = -5
2. Use the ceiling or floor function to give a mathematical expression (e.g. 2y, y/4) for the number of boxes:
	1. A baker is packaging cookies for sale in boxes of 8. He has y cookies to put into boxes. How many boxes can he sell?
		1. Floor of [y/8] boxes
# 4.3 Properties of Functions
## Function Properties
1. How should/will the elements in domain **RELATE** to elements in target given some function?
	1. Three definitions:
		1. one-to-one (injective)
		2. onto (surjective)
		3. one-to-one and onto (bijective)
### One-to-one (Injective)
1. f: D -> T is one-to-one if no two elements in the domain map to the same element in the target
2. Example: When mapping dental hygienists to offices, **all hygienists have separate offices and some offices may by empty**
3. |D| <= |T|
### Onto (surjective)
1. f: D -> T is onto if every element in the target is mapped to by some element in the domain
2. Example (cont): ....**all offices are used and some may be shared; no empty offices**
3. |D| >= |T| and range = target
4. For every y ∈ T, there is an x ∈ D, such that f(x) = y
### One-to-one and Onto (bijective)
1. f: D -> T is a bijection if it is one-to-one and onto
2. No two elements in the domain map to the same element in the target
3. Every element in the target is mapped to by some element in the domain
4. Example (cont): When mapping dental hygienists to offices, all offices are used and each hygienists has a separate office
5. |D| = |T|
6. It's a one-to-one correspondence
# Inverse Functions
1. Does every function have an inverse function?
	1. No
2. When does the inverse of a function exist?
	1. If the function is a bijective; |D| = |T|
		1. f;D -> T
		2. f^-1;T -> D
	2. Reverse each ordered pair... if should result in well-defined function ((1,2)->(2,1))
	3. This applies to both finite and infinite domains
3. Note: One way to show a bijective is to show the function has an inverse
# Composition of Functions
1. What is Composition?
	1. The process of applying a function to the result of another function
	2. The output of one function is the input of the next function
	3. It's expressed as:
		1. (f ^O g)(x) or f(g(x))
		2. "the composition of f with g"
	4. Example:
		1. Given: f(x) = x^5 and g(x): = 3x^2 + 7, find
			1. f(g(x)) = f(3x^2 + 7) = (3x^2 + 7)^5
			2. g(f(x)) = 3(x^5)^2 + 7
			3. These results are not the same: (f ^O g)(x) != (g ^O f)(x)
# Identity Function
1. What is the Indentity Function
	1. It's a function that always maps a set onto itself and maps every element onto itself
2. Given set A
	1. IA: is a function whose domain and range is A
	2. IA: A -> A
	3. For every a ∈ A, IA (a) = a
3. Example:
	1. A = {a, b, c, d}
# Exponential Function
1. An exponential function is
	1. Either increasing (growth) or decreasing (decay)
		1. Knowing this helps with predicting and approximation
	2. A bijection (one-to-one and onto) so **has an inverse**
	3. Its inverse is a **logarithmic function**
		1. y = (2)^x and y = log2x are inverse functions
		2. y = (e)^2x and y = 1/2logex are inverse functions
		3. To create the inverse of a function, switch the y and x then solve for y
	4. Exponential functions differ from power functions
		1. y = x^2 NOT exponential
		2. y = 2^x IS exponential
## Properties
1. b^x * b^y = b^(x+y)
2. (b^x)^y = b^xy
3. (b^x)/(b^y) = b^(x-y)
4. (bc)^x = b^x * c^x
5. logb(xy) = logbx + logby
6. logb(x/y) = logbx - logby
7. logb(x^y) = ylogbx
8. lobcx = (logbx/logbc)
Examples:
1. 2 * log3 10 = log3 10^2
2. (2^(x-1))^4 = 2^4x-4
3. ((log3(k)^2)/(log3 25)) = ((2 log3 k)/(2 log3 5)) = ((log3 k)/(log3 5)) = log 5 k
