# What is Discrete Mathematics?
## It is **NOT** part of the "Calculus track"
Where Continuous phenomena are studied. Used for physical sciences and engineering. Trig, Calc I, Calc II
## It **IS**
**The study of finite and countable sets**. The language and abstractions required to reason about many concepts in computer science
# What can we solve with Discrete Math?
1. How many ways can a password be chosen following specific rules?
2. How many valid internet addresses are there?
3. How do I encrypt a message?
4. How do I sort a list of integers so that the integers are in increasing order?
5. Find the shortest tour that visits each of a group of cities only once and then ends in the starting city. 
## Inductive vs. Deductive Logic
1. *Deductive* (or **formal**) *logic* is the logic of *necessary* inference
	1. Deals with exact truth and falsehood of statements, and the rules for generating truth and falsehood out of multiple statements.
2. *Inductive* (or **informal**) *logic* is the logic of *contingent* inference
	1. Deals with what is *reasonable*
		1. Argument or *rhetoric*
		2. Does not provide exact truth or falsehood
		3. Depends on the principles involved
			1. There can thus be more than one "logical" conclusion depending on the principles assumed
## **What** is Logic?
1. Logic is the science of reasoning
2. An intersection of psychology and mathematics =
	1. and integral in Philosophy
3. A branch of mathematics
## Propositions
1. It's a **STATEMENT** this is either TRUE or FALSE
	1. It's **TRUTH VALUE** can be known, unknown, or matter of opinion.
	2. Typically a declarative statement
2. The most basic element in logic
3. Not a proposition:
	1. How are you? (question)
	2. Have a nice day! (command)
	3. Yes! (exclamation)
4. **Variables** are used to denote propositions
	1. Usually p, q, r, s
		1. p: 4 is a prime number
		2. q: 11 is a rational number
	2. T or F is the value
5. In a **compound proposition**, the propositions are connected by **logical operations**
	1. Let's explore several operations
## Logical Operations	
1. **Conjunction**
	1. p ^ q (read "p AND q")
	2. Only true when p AND q are true
	3. Use truth table to determine truth value
2. **Disjunction**
	1. p \\/ q (read "p OR q")
	2. Only false when both p and q are false
	3. Same as "inclusive" OR
	4. Use truth value to determine truth value
3. "OR" has two meanings in English, context is needed
4. **Disjunction** has two interpretations
	1. **Inclusive OR**
		1. EX: The patient should not take the medication if she has a history of migraines or she has diabetes
		2. Symbol: \\/
		3. TRUE if either or both propositions are true
	2. **Exclusive XOR**
		1. EX: I will drive or ride my bike to work today
		2. Symbol: ⊕
		3. Think either/or
		4. TRUE if exactly one of the propositions is true; false is both propositions are true
5. **Negation**
	1. Acts on just one proposition
		1. -| p (read "NOT p")
		2. Other negation phrases
			1. "It is not the case that"
			2. "It is false that"
		3. The truth value of -| depends on the truth value of p
		4. Example:	
			1. p: It is not raining today
			2. -| p: It is raining today
## Truth Tables
1. Truth tables show the truth value for every possible combination of truth values for variables in compound propositions
## Compound Propositions
1. Compound Propositions are connected with at least one logical operation
	1. Order of precedence without () used: -|, ^, \\/
	2. Parentheses specify order
		1. (p \\/ p) ^ r
		2. () not needed for: -|, p^q^r, p\\/q\\/r
## Creating a Truth Table
1. Create one row for EVERY possible combination of truth assignments for ALL variables
2. How many rows needed
# Conditional Statements 1.3
## Conditional Proposition p -> q
1. p->q is stated as "If p, then q"
2. Operation: ->
3. A **Conditional proposition** is like a **contrast** between two parties.
	1. **Hypothesis (p) -> Conclusion (q)**
	2. The only way for a conditional statement to be FALSE is if...
		1. Hypothesis is **true** and 
		2. Conclusion is **false**
	3. Also called "implication"..."p implies q"
## p -> q In English
1. If p, then q
	1. if p, q
2. p implies q
3. q, if p
4. p only if q (the only way for p to be true is if q is also true)
5. p is sufficient for q
6. q is necessary for p
Examples:
	1. Interest rates will not go down but I am still going to buy a house
		1. (~i) ^ h
	2. I will buy a house only if interest rates go down
		1. h -> i
	3. Interest rates going down is sufficient condition for me to buy a house
		1. i -> h
	4. If Interest rates don't go down, I won't buy a house.
		1. -|i -> -|h
	5. Even though interests rates are going down, I am not going to buy a house
		1. i ^ -|h
## Relatives of p->q
1. Three conditional statements are closely related to p->q:
	1. Converse          q -> p
	2. Contrapositive -|q -> -|p
	3. Inverse             -|p -> -|q
2. Is it logical equivalent to p->q?
	1. Converse (q->p) is NOT logically equivalent
	2. Contrapositive (-|q -> -|p) IS Logically equivalent 
3. Example
	1. Conditional: If I am  sleeping, then I am breathing (p->q)
	2. Converse: If I am breathing, then I am sleeping (q->p)
	3. Contrapositive: If I am NOT breathing, then I am NOT sleeping 
	(-|q->-|p)
	5. Inverse: If I am NOT sleeping, then I am NOT breathing (-|p->-|q)
## Bi-conditional operation p<->q
1. Operation <-> 
2. Stated as "if and only if" or iff
3. **p <-> q** is True whenever p and q have the *same truth value*
4. Called "double implications"
## Order of Operations
1. For compound propositions the order of operations is: -|, ^, \\/, ->, <->
	1. Use () to clarify order: (p->q) ^ r
# 1.4 Logical Equivalence
1. When are two compound propositions logically equivalent?
	1. Same truth value for EVERY combination of truth values
	2. "p<->q" and "p*=*q" both denote p and q as logically equivalent
## De Morgan's Laws
1. 1st Law = ~(p\\/q) == (~p^~q)
2. 2st Law = -|
# 1.5 Laws of Propositional Logic
1. Why are laws needed?
	1. For **substitution** to show that two propositions are logically equivalent
	2. To **simplify** compound propositions
2. Hint: Replace a compound proposition with a variable...a for (s ^ t) and b for (t \\/ r)

# 1.11 - 1.12 Logical Reasoning
## What is an **argument**
1. A sequence of propositions (**hypotheses**), followed by a final proposition (the **conclusion**)
2. An argument is **VALID** is the conclusion is **TRUE** when ALL hypotheses are **TRUE** otherwise the argument is **INVALID**
3. Valid when (p1 ^ p2 ^ ... ^ pn) -> c is a tautology
## Form of Argument
1. Logical arguments can be expressed in English with careful attention to form
