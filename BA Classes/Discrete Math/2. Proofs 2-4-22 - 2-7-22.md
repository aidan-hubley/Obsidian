# 2.1 Mathematical Definitions
## Math Definitions
1. What can be proven?
	1. Facts amount numbers (proven with standard algebra)
	2. Facts about mathematical objects...
		1. Graphs
		2. Functions
		3. Sequences
		4. Sums
	3. Proof requires **rigorous definitions**
	4. Need to turn intuition/qualitative understanding into formal definitions
## Even and odd integers
1. Only integers can be even or odd
### Even
1. An integer x is even if there is an integer k such that x = 2k
2. Ask: "Can the number be divided by 2?"
3. Is "0" even?
	1. Yes
### Odd
1. An integer x is odd if there is an integer k such that x = 2k + 1
2. "k" can be replaced by an expression (ex: n + 1)
	1. n is an integer, is the number 2n + 3 even or odd?
## Parity
1. What is Parity?
	1. Parity means equality, balance
	2. The parity of a number depends only on its remainder after dividing by 2
		1. EVEN: Parity 0 because the remainder after dividing by 2 is 0
		2. ODD: Parity 1 because the remainder after dividing by 2 is 1
2. Numbers have **"same parity"** or **"opposite parity"**
3. Parity can be used to verify is an EQUALITY is true or false
	1. Arithmetic rules of parity:
		1. even +- even = even
		2. odd +- odd = even
		3. odd * odd = odd
		4. even * odd = even
## Rational Numbers
1. A number r is rational if there exist integers x and y such that r = x/y and y != 0)
	1. Note: the choice of x and y is not necessarily unique
		1. If r = 0.25, than x/y = 25/100 = 1/4
		2. if r = -1.25, and y = 100, show r is rational
	2. Is a rational number?
		1. Yes
## Real Number System
1. Real Numbers
	1. Rational 
		1. Integers
			1. Whole
				1. Natural
	2. Irrational
# 2.2 Intro to Proofs
## Theorems
1. What is a **Theorem?**
	1. A statement that can be proven to be **TRUE** by accepted mathematical operations and arguments
	2. A proof shows a theorem to be true
	2. Most theorems are assertions about ALL elements in a set (i.e. integers) so are **universal statements**
		1. "for all" or "for every" might NOT be stated
		2. Example:
			1. "The square of an even integer is even."
			2. What is the domain? all integers
			3. Can re-stated in English as
				1. "if x is an integer and x is even, then x^2 is even."
		3. Example:
			1. "The sum of two positive real numbers is greater than the average of the two numbers."
				1. Domains for x and y? all real numbers
				2. Can be stated in logic as:
					1. Ɐx Ɐy, (x > 0 and y > 0) -> ((x + y) > (x + y)/2)
	3. Are some theorems **existential statements?** Yes
		1. Example:
			1. "There is a perfect square that is the sum of two non-zero perfect squares."
				1. The statement is saying that there exists three numbers, x, y, z such that x + y = z, where x, y, and z are all perfect squares and x and y are not equal to 0
			2. Universal or existential? Determine this first
			3. Related note: the **domains** can differ for the variables within a proof
2. What is a **Proof**?
	1. A sequence of steps whose final step should result in the statement of the theorem being proven
		1. Can use other proven theorems
		2. Assumes a set of axioms (or statements); we will assume basic algebra (i.e, we will not prove 1 + 1 = 2)
## Proof
1. What types of proofs?
	1. **LOGICAL Proofs**
		1. Consist of a proposition and a justification for each step
	2. **WRITTEN Proofs**
		1. Consist of sentences AND mathematical expressions
2. Why are proofs important in computer science?
	1. To establish that a program works as expected
	2. To show that cryptosystem is secure
	3. To validate a set of inferences (aka conclusions) in AI (artificial intelligence)
## Ending a Proof
1. Use ▢ to end a proof
	1. Represents Q.E.D
		1. "That which was to be demonstrated"
	2. Also called "tombstone"
## Brainstorming a proof
1. THEORM:
	1. Every positive integer is greater than or equal to its reciprocal
2. BRAINSTORMING PROCESS:
	1. Translate: if x is an integer and x > 0, then x >= 1/x
		1. What is being proven? (x > 0) -> (x >= 1/x)
	2. Universal or existential? Ɐx ((x > 0) -> (x >= 1/x))
	3. Domain? all integers (Z)
3. Proof:
	1. Let x be an integer, where x > 0
	2. If x is an integer and x > 0, then x >= 1
	3. Since x is positive, we can multiply both sides of x >= 1 by x to get x^2 >= x
	4. Since x^2 >= x and x >= 1, then x^2 >= 1
	5. Since x is positive, we can divide both sides of x^2 >= 1 by x to get (x^2 / x) >= ...... CANVAS
## Thoughts on Proofs...
1. Most difficult part? Deciding where to start
2. Proofs follow a small number of patterns (in this course)
3. "Proofs are rarely conceived in their simplest form."
	1. Trial and error needed
	2. like mazes, dead ends are inevitable
4. Explore other proofs and explanations (or watch videos) to build understanding of process
## Tremaux's algorithm
1. Four rules:
	1. Walk until you reach an intersection
	2. If the intersection hasn't been visited, mark it and choose a passage at random
	3. If it has been visited, treat it like a dead-end
	4. When retracing your steps, take any unvisited passages you encounter along the way
	## Counterexamples
	1. What is a Counterexample?
		1. An assignment of values to variables that shows that a **universal statement** is False
		2. Only ONE counterexample is needed
		3. May need to consider many examples to find a counterexample
		4. For **conditional statements**, a counterexample must satisfy ALL the hypotheses and contradict the conclusion
			1. "If x is a real number and x < 1, than x^2 < x."
				1. x = 2? Can't be a counterexample because not < 1
				2. x = -1? Yes, a counterexample
	2. Write a mathematical statement then find a counterexample
		1. Every real number is less than its square
			1. Statement: x < x^2
			2. Counterexample: x = 1/2
	## Rewrite the Theorem
	1. Rewrite each of the statements using sentences and algebraic expressions (i.e. x < x^2) Use variable names to denote arbitrary numbers in the domain
		1. "Every positive integer is greater than or equal to its reciprocal."
			1. If x is an integer and x > 0 , then x >= 1/x
		2. "There is no largest integer."
			1. If x is an integer, then there is some integer y such that y > x
		3. "Every real number besides 0 has a multiplicative inverse"
			1. Let x be real number such that x != 0, then there is a real number y such that xy = 1
# 2.5 Proofs by Contrapositive
1. Proof by **Contrapositive**
	1. Only applies to p -> q
	2. Contrapositive of p -> q is (~q -> ~p)
2. When is it useful?
	1. Direct proof is difficult
	2. Assuming negation of conclusion is easier than assuming hypothesis
3. If >1 hypothesis, only need to show ONE is false
	1. Why? If conclusion is false, then H1 and H2 are not both true
4. Proof by Contrapositive works because
	1. Ɐx (H(x) -> C(x)) <-> Ɐx (~C(x) -> ~H(x))
5. **THEOREM:** If x and y are real numbers and xy is irrational, then x is irrational or y is irrational
	1. In a proof by Contrapositive of the theorem above, what is assumed and what must be proven?
		1. Assume: x is rational or y is rational
			1. Prove: xy is irrational
6. **THEOREM:** The sum of any two consecutive integers is odd
7. **PROOF:** by Contrapositive
