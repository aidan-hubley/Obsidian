# 5.1 Boolean Algebra
## Digital Logic
1. What is **digital logic**?
	1. Boolean algebra has become the basis of computer circuit design because the native language of computers is expressed in 0s and 1s. Digital logic is the underlying logic system that drives electronic circuit board design and is a common part of electrical engineering and design courses.
## Boarder Boolean Algebra
1. "Boolean Algebra" means slightly different things to different communities
	1. In mathematics,
		1. A "boolean algebra" is a set of elements that has two binary operators (and, or) and a unary operator (not) and obeys algebraic laws (assoc, commut, etc.)
	2. In the Discrete Math course
		1. its the set {0,1} with three operators (complement, +, -)
2. What is **Boolean Algebra**
	1. It's a mathematical system with an underlying set of elements
	2. A **set of rules and operations** for working with variables whose values are either 0 or 1
	3. Equivalent to logic
		1. 0, false, open, off
		2. 1, true, closed, on
	4. Three operators
		1. AND, use *, same as /\
		2. OR, use +, same as \\/
		3. NOT, use complement, same as ~
## Rules of Precedence
1. Multiplication before addition but can override this with ()
2. Complement applied to entire value under the bar; calculate value first
# 5.2 Boolean Functions
1. A **Boolean Function** can be defined by:
	1. an input/output table
	2. a Boolean expression
	3. logic diagram (or logic circuit)
## Input/Output table
1. A boolean function with k input variables will require an input/output table with 2^k rows
2. Every **Boolean expression** has an equivalent **input/output table**
	1. Each row of the table defining the function corresponds to a minterm (if using minterms)
	2. Does every input/output table have an equivalent Boolean expression?
		1. Yes, at least one. Expression can be written with minterms and maxterm
## Minterm & Maxterm
1. Given f(x, y, z) a function with 3 variables
	1. Some minterms of f(x, y, z)
		1. x_yz
		2. xyz
2. Maxterms:
	1. Each term is a sum containing all input variables
	2. Consider every row evaluating to 0
3. How do we express functions using minterms?
	1. Locate rows in which the output value of f(x, y) = 1
	2. Write minterm for each of these rows
	3. Write the sum of these products (SOP)
