# Lydia Davis, "The Outing"

An outburst of anger near the road, a refusal to speak on the path, a
silence in the pine woods, a silence across the old railroad bridge, an
attempt to be friendly in the water, a refusal to end the argument on the
flat stones, a cry of anger on the steep bank of dirt, a weeping among the
bushes.

# Activity: An "Outing" of Your Own

- Write your own version of "The Outing." You may choose to convey a very specific story, or you may choose to let the words tell whatever story they will.
- Whatever your approach, the resulting story should resemble "The Outing" in form and style. That is, it should be composed of 8-10 sentences all following the same basic structure: "A/an (action) by/one/at the (location)"
- Less is more, keep it simple and let silence speak.

A struggle by the docks, a busy car alarm in the street, a fleeting silence in 
the city, an urgent phone call received at the station, an approaching siren 
in the distance, a dragging moment in the smog air, a rush to the hospital, 
a lonely tear in the waiting room, a life saved in the city.
