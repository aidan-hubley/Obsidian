# How do we Define Plot?
- Most simply, as a series of events
	- "The arrangement of the incidents" ([Aristotle], Poetics)
	- "The pattern or structure of textual events ... a sequence of actions related by chronology and perhaps also by causality" (Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics)
	- According to Northrop Frye "plot is theme in movement; theme is plot at rest" (ibid.)

# Plot: Some Useful Terms and Concepts
- *in medias res*: "in the middle of things": when the narrative begins in a series of events *already underway*
- *frame story*: a literary devices presenting a story within a story (or story within a story within a story etc.)
- *fabula vs. syuzhet* (Viktor Shklovsky)
	- *fabula*: "Events as ordered in the context of the story" (the "raw material")
	- *syuzhet*: "Events as the text arranges and presents them" (how the story is purposefully organized)
