## Problem: Social Media

- Think back to when you first downloaded Instagram, Snap, Twitter, or whatever
- Why? What did you want out of it? 
- Where you looking for that the endless scrolling that has blown up from TikTok?
- How about a way to use your time, the global average screen time is now 6 hours and 58 mins a day.
- I'm willing to bet that no, you simply wanted to connect with your people, even while you were physically distance.
- At least That's what I was looking for, simply a way to digitally communicate with people.
- I wanted to maintain connections.

- But instead, we've landing somewhere else. 
- Slowly and deliberately Social media's core functionality has changed, and it might have inadvertently changed why you use it

## Problem: Faith Online
- Have you ever tried to send a prayer request on social media?
	- Maybe through an Instagram story post, or in your Res Hall's GroupMe chat
- When I do, I get this strange uncanny valley feeling
	- As if I am using a tool for something that it is no longer designed to do
-  These flagship applications are too worldly, attention seeking, and distracting to facilitate true faith-based conversation, let alone genuine prayer requests  

## Solution
- A platform that focuses solely on the maintaining and cultivating faith-based relationships of connected users.
- A virtual space to send and receive prayer requests
- Users can view all public prayer requests from others in their connection sphere
	- They can "commit" to pray for requests, which will notify the user that someone is praying for them
- Committed users would receive push notifications to continue prayer
- How is this unique?
	- Other faith community applications focus on exclusive demographics, some orient towards users going through hardships, others focus only on church organizations

## Demographic:
- Christians
- Technically-Inclined
- College students on break
- Church 

## Tech Stack
#### React Native + React Native Elements / NativeBase
React Native is a preferred technology to develop for iOS and Android. In addition to the base of React Native, a UI/UX library would be optimal. React Native will be running on Node.js. Options include but are not limited to React Native Elements and NativeBase.

#### Mongo DB
A NoSQL service such as Mongo DB, is the optimal choice of technology to develop a database. Storing user information, prayer requests, and community data requires a database, Mongo DB will integrate with a React Native application seamlessly.

#### One Signal
A service to implement push notifications is critical to the workflow of Prayer Chain. One Signal offers APIs to send notifications to userâ€™s devices from the server. The APIs allow specific users or groups to be notified at once.
