# Usability 101
- 1 - Intuitive
- 0 - Questions about where I am
- 1 - Easy to use

# Principles
- **Layout** - Command / Navigation are on the top or left. Status information is usually in a footer
- **Content Awareness** - User should be aware where they are in an app or process (without making them want to quit)
- **Aesthetics**: Watch the balance between white space & density
- **Usage Level**: Streamline based on frequently / essential used elements (or step infrequent users through)
- **Consistency**: Users should be able to predict app behavior
- **Minimize User Effort**: The app should be intuitive (easy to learn) and quick to use

# 1 Concern & 3 Applications
- Understand your users
	- Interviews
	- Personas
	- Roles
	- Use scenarios (in your Use Case or User Stories)
- Navigation
	- Menus
	- Page Flows
	- Status Indicators
- Inputs
	- Layouts
	- Controls
	- Prompts/Validations/Alerts
- Outputs
	- Screens
	- Static (Reports; Extracts)
	- Dynamic (BI)

# Tools
- **Heuristic** - Create a list, team members compare to the list, meet as a team
- **Walk-Trough** - Walk-through the prototype with prospective users, explains the interface
- **Interface** - Allows a group to interact with the prototype and provide feedback (Cannot be storyboards)
- **Formal Usability Testing** - Video users and record keystrokes, normally over an hour and takes 2-3 hours to review. Needs 5-10 users to get reliable results
