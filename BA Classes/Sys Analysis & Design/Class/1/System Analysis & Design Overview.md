#SysAnlysisDesignConcepts
This is not a technology problem

# Overview
- Planning 
- Analysis
- Design
- Implementation
- (ongoing) Deployment
- Monitoring & Support

Note: In the modern software, this cycle from Planning to its Deployment could be as short has 24 hours

# Planning
Answering the why and how.
-   How could we do this technically?
-   Is the project sustainable?
-   Do we believe it will provide value to the people/process for which we’re building it?
-   What/how are external factors affecting/likely to affect this system?
-   Who’s going to stand behind the project?

# Analysis
Answering the who, what, where, when
-   Characterized by requirements process
-   Understanding the problem space
-   Empathizing with the humans affected by the problem
-   Study the problem in its current state
-   Scope a solution that can deliver on the objectives laid out in planning

# Design
How will the solution practically function?
-   Technical architecture & data design
-   System / process architecture (how will humans / systems use it)?
-   Prototyping and framework validation

# Implementation
What are we delivering and how are we doing it?
-   System management, deployment & support methodology
-   System construction (including documentation)

# Deployment
How (frequently & reliably) will we deliver changes? 
-   Ensuring a system of validation and quality control
-   Measuring, resolving, and reporting the impact of change

# Monitoring & Support
Are we meeting our objectives?
-   Is the system performant?
-   How are we detecting and resolving issues?
-   Are we measuring and meeting our business objectives?
-   How can we know what the next/future state of the system should be?

# Project Frameworks Comparison
##### Waterfall and Agile Methodologies
## Waterfall
-   Invests in the complete understanding and description of the problem & solution before implementation
-   Implies replication / previous experience with the command of the problem space and variables
-   Predicated on exact cost, timelines, feature-complete definitions
-   Presumes a predictable rate of change in external factors
##### *Why would Waterfall be a preferred methodology?

## Agile
- Learn
- Plan
- Design
- Develop
- Ship
- Monitor

## State of our Craft?
### Agile is today's best practice
