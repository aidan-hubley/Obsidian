--- What are the 2 types of acquisitions?
1. Live Box
2. Dead Box

--- What are the advantages to doing a live acquisitions?
- You can get volatile data

--- Which takes longer to acquire?
- Live takes longer because many processes are still running

--- What are the 2 types of Image formats?
1. DD (raw, no metadata)
2. EO1 (broke into segments, has metadata)

---What is the difference between a Raw and EO1?
- Raw doesn't have metadata and is a single huge chuck
- EO1 has metadata and is in segments

Always acquire the E01 file, everyone will accept them


## Writeblockers

- When doing a deadbox acquisition, use writeblockers

---What does a writeblocker do?
- Protects you from writing to the source file and from the source file writing to you

--- What are the 2 types of writeblockers?
- Software
- Hardware

## Order of Volatility
-- High to low --

1. registers, cache
2. routing table, arp cache, process table, kernel statistics, memory
3. temporary file systems
4. disk
5. remote logging and monitoring data that is relevant to the system in question
6. physical configuration, network topology
7. archival media
