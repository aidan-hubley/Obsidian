# 3.1 Earth as a System: The Rock Cycle
1. The Basic Cycle
	1. Magma: Crystallization above or below ground to form igneous rock
	2. Weathering: Breakdown of a mineral at the Earth's surface
	3. Sediment: Solid particles produced through weathering
	4. Lithification: Conversion of sediments through compaction and crystallization by groundwater to form sedimentary rock
	5. Metamorphism: Change due to high temperatures and pressures below ground to form metamorphic rock
# Alternate Paths
1. Full cycle does not always take place due to "shortcuts" or interruptions
	1. Sedimentary rock melts
	2. Igneous rock is metamorphosed
	3. Sedimentary rock is weathered
	4. Metamorphic rock is weathered
# Igneous Rocks: "Formed by Fire"
1. form as magma cools and crystallizes
	1. Rocks formed inside Earth are called plutonic or intrusive rocks
	2. Rocks formed on the surface
		1. Formed form lava (a material similar to magma, but without gas)
		2. Called volcanic or extrusive rocks
# From Magma to Crystalline Rock
1. Composed of silicate minerals 
	1. Ions are arranged into orderly patterns during cooling
	2. Crystal size is determined by the rate of cooling
		1. Slow rate forms large crystals
		2. Fast rate forms microscopic crystals
		3. Very fast rate forms glass
# Igneous Compositions
1. Mainly composed of silicate minerals
	1. Granitic (Felsic) Compositions
		1. Richer in light silicates
	2. Basaltic (Mafic) Compositions
		1. Richer in dark silicates
# What Can Igneous Textures Tell Us?
1. Texture: size, shape, and arrangement of minerals that make up  rock
2. Fine-grained  - fast rate of cooling
3. Coarse-grained - slow rate of cooling
4. Porphyritic (two crystal sizes) - two rates of cooling
5. Glassy - very fast rate of cooling
6. Vesicular - contains hole left by gas bubbles
7. Pyroclastic - fragmented; produced by consolidation of volcanic fragments
# Common Igneous Rocks
1. Granitic Rocks
	1. Felsic: composed of light-colored silicates - quartz and feldspar
	2. Common: granite, rhyolite, obsidian
2. Andesitic (Intermediate) Rocks
	1. Mixture of felsic and mafic composition
	2. Common: andesite, diorite
3. Basaltic Rocks
	1. Mafic: composed of dark-colored silicates
	2. Common: basalt, gabbro
# How Igneous Rocks Form
1. Explained by Bowen's reaction series, which shows the order of mineral crystallization
2. Influenced by crystal settling in the magma
# Sedimentary Rocks: Compacted and Cemented Sediment
1. Form from sediment (weathered products)
2. About 75% of all rocks outcrops on the continents
3. Used to reconstruct much of Earth's history
	1. Clues to past environments
	2. Provide information about sediment transport
	3. Rocks often contain fossils
# Types of Sedimentary Rocks
1. Detrital
	1. Solid particles from weathering
	2. Classified by particle size and shape
	3. Common: conglomerate, breccia, sandstone, siltstone, shale
# Types of Sedimentary Rocks
1. Chemical, Biochemical, and Organic
	1. Derived from Ions carried in solution to lakes and seas
	2. Classified by composition
	3. Common: Limestone, gypsum, chert, coal
# Lithification of Sediment
1. Lithification: processes by which sediments are transformed into sedimentary rocks
	1. Compaction
		1. Overlying sediment
	2. Cementation
		1. By Calcite, Silica, and Iron Oxide
# Features of Sedimentary Rocks
1. Strata or beds (most characteristics)
	1. Accumulated layers of sediment over time
	2. Record past environments
2. Fossils
	1. Traces or remains of prehistoric life
	2. Are the most important inclusions
	3. Help determine past environments 
	4. Used as time indicators
	5. Used for matching rocks from different places
# Metamorphic Rocks: New Rock from Old
1. Form from preexisting igneous, sedimentary, or metamorphic rocks
2. Take place due to temperatures and pressures unlink those in which it formed
3. Leads to changes in mineralogy, texture, and chemical composition
4. Often progresses incrementally
5. Degrees of metamorphism
	1. Exhibited by rock texture and mineralogy
	2. Low-grade, slight changes (e.g. shale becomes slate)
	3. High-grade, obliteration of original features (e.g. shale becomes gneiss)
# What Drives Metamorphism?
1. Metamorphic agents
	1. Heat
	2. Pressure (stress)
		1. confining pressure - from burial
		2. Differential stress - occurs during mountain building
	3. Chemically active fluids
		1. Mainly water and other volatiles
		2. Promote recrystallization by enhancing ion migration
# Metamorphic Textures
1. Foliation
	1. Flat arrangement of mineral grains or structures
	2. Minerals are perpendicular to the compressional force
	3. Common: Slate, phyllite, schist, gneiss
2. Nonfoilated texture
	1. Contain equidimensional crystals 
	2. resembles a coarse-grained igneous rock
	3. Common: quartzite, marble
# Resources from Rocks and Minerals
1. Metallic mineral resources
	1. Gold, silver, copper, mercury, lead, etc.
	2. Produced by Igneous and Metamorphic processes
	3. Most important ore deposits are generated from hydrothermal (hot-water) solutions
		1. Pegmatites: form fluid-rich environment, have unusually large crystals
		2. Vein deposits in fractures or bedding planes
		3. Disseminated deposits that are distributed throughout the rock
# Nonmetallic Mineral Resources
1. Make use of the material's
	1. Nonmetallic elements
	2. Physical and / or chemical properties
2. Two broad groups
	1. Building materials (limestone, gypsum)
	2. Industrial minerals (fluorite, corundum, sylvite)
# Energy Resources
1. Coal
	1.
