# 5.1 What is an Earthquake?
1. Ground shaking of Earth produced by the rapid release od energy along faults
1. Releases seismic waves, a form of energy that travels through the Earth
	1. Hypocenter (focus): Location where slippage begins
	2. Epicenter: Point on Earth's surface directly above the hypocenter
## Discovering the Causes of Earthquakes
1. Associated with movements along faults
	1. Explained by the plate tectonics theory
	2. Mechanism for earthquakes was first explained by H Reid
		1. Rocks "spring back" - a phenomena called elastic rebound
		2. Vibrations (earthquakes) occur as rock elastically returns to its original shape
## What is Elastic Rebound Theory?
1. Explain how energy is stored in rocks
	1. Rocks bend until the strength of the rock is exceeded
	2. Rupture occurs and the rocks quickly rebound to an undeformed shape
	3. Energy is released in waves that radiate outward from the fault
## Aftershocks and Foreshocks
1. Earthquakes are often preceded by foreshocks
	1. Foreshocks
		1. Earthquakes of lesser magnitude preceding the major earthquake
	2. Aftershocks
		1. Earthquakes of lesser magnitude occurring after the major earthquake
		2. Can occur months or years after a major event
## Faults and Large Earthquakes
1. Explained by plate tectonics theory
	1. Sudden release of stress built up from plate movements
	2. Associated with plate boundaries
		1. Convergent boundaries produce some of the largest due to immense build up of pressure
		2. Transform boundaries can produce earthquakes along any of its numerous branches
		3. Divergent boundaries produce small earthquakes
# 5.2 Seismology: The Study of Earthquake Waves
1. Earthquake waves
	1. Seismology: study of earthquake waves
	2. Seismography: earthquake recording instrument
		1. Records movement of Earth
		2. Record is calls a seismogram
## Seismic Waves
1. Types of earthquake waves
	1. Body waves
		1. Primary (P) waves
			1. Push-Pull (compressional) motion
			2. Travel through solids, liquids, and gasses
			3. Greatest velocity of all earthquake waves
		2. Secondary (S) waves
			1. "Shake" motion
			2. Travel only though solids
			3. Slower velocity than P waves
	2. Surface Waves
		1. Complex motion
		2. Slowest velocity of all waves
# 5.3 Locating the Source of an Earthquake
1. Location the epicenter
	1. Use seismogram from at least 3 seismic stations
	2. Use a time-travel graph to determine the distance the seismic waves traveled
	3. Draw a circle with the radius of the distance form the seismic station to the epicenter around each seismic station
	4. Using triangulation, the circles intersect at the approximate epicenter
# 5.4 Determining the Size of an Earthquake
1. Intensity
	1. A measure of the degree of earthquake shaking at a given locale based on the amount of damage
	2. Most often measured by the Modified Mercalli Intensity Scale
2. Magnitude
	1. Often measured using the Richter scale
		1. Based on the amplitude of the largest seismic wave
		2. A 10-fold increase in wave amplitude results to an increase of 1 on the scale
		3. Each unity of Richter magnitude equates to roughly a 32-fold energy increase
		4. Does not estimate adequately the size of very large earthquakes
	2. Moment magnitude
		1. Measures total energy released 
		2. Derived by
			1. Amount of slip on the fault
			2. Area of the fault that ruptured the surface
			3. Strength of the rock
		3. Good for measuring medium and large earthquakes
# 5.5 Earthquake Destruction
1. Factors that determine structural damage
	1. Intensity of the earthquake
	2. Duration o the vibrations
	3. Nature of the material upon which the structure rests
	4. The design of the structure
2. Destruction results from	
	1. Ground shaking
	2. Wave Amplification based on ground material
	3. Liquefaction of the ground
		1. Saturated material turns fluid
		2. Underground objects may float to surface
	4. Landslides and ground subsidence
	5. Fires
	6. Tsunami
		1. Generated from displacement of the ocean floor
		2. Tsunami Warning Systems using ocean buoys helps warn people in path
# 5.6 Where Do Most Earthquakes Occur?
1. 95% of energy from earthquakes in a few narrow zones
2. All plate boundaries produce earthquakes
	1. Circum-Pacific belt
	2. Alpine-Himalayan belt
# 5.7 Earthquakes: Predictions, Forecasts, and Mitigation
1. Predictions
	1. Short-range forecasts
		1. No reliable method yet discovered for short-range prediction
		2. Look for precursors: foreshocks, ground elevation changes
	2. Long-range forecasts
		1. Paleseismology: Study of past earthquakes
		2. Seismic Gaps: Premise is that earthquakes are repetitive and a region is given a probability of a quake
## Minimizing Earthquake Hazards
1. Earthquakes don't kill people: buildings kill people
2. Building earthquake-resistant structures
3. Earthquake warning systems measuring P waves shut down infrastructure in Japan immediately
# 5.8 Earth's Interior
1. Most of our knowledge of Earth's Interior comes from the study of P and S earthquake waves
	1. Travel times of P and S waves through Earth vary depending on the properties of the materials
	3. S waves travel only through solids
## Earth's Layered Structure
1. Layers based on physical properties
	1. Crust
		1. Thin, rocky outer layer
		2. Varies in thickness
			1. Roughly 7km (5 miles) in oceanic regions
			2. Continental crust averages 35-40km (22-25)
			3. Exceeds 70 km (40 miles) in some mountainous regions
		3. Continental crust
			1. Upper crust composed of granitic rocks
			2. Lower crust is more akin to basalt
			3. Average density is about 2.7 g/cm^3
			4. Up to 4 billion years old
		4. Oceanic crust
			1. Basaltic composition
			2. Density about 3.0 g/cm^3
			3. Younger (180 million years or less) than the continental crust
		5. Outer Core
			1. S waves don't pass through - liquid 
			2. A sphere having a radius of 3468 km (2161 miles)
			3. Composed of an iron-nickel alloy
			4. Average density of nearly 11 g/cm^3
		6. Inner core
			1. Sphere with a radius of 1216 km (754 miles) 
			2. Behaves like a solid due to extreme pressure 13 g/cm^3
2. A **Cryoseism** also known as an ice quake or a frost quake, is a seismic event that may be caused by a sudden cracking action in frozen soil or rock saturated with water or ice. As water drains into the ground, it may eventually freeze and expand under colder temperatures, putting stress on its surroundings. This stress builds up until relieved explosively in the form of cryoseism.
