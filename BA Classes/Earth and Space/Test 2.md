Study Guide for Test #2 (Scheduled for March 21st)
# Geologic Time:
What majority animal class lived during the Mesozoic Era?
- Dinosaurs
We are currently living in which era?
- Cenozoic Era
What geologic period was formed during a time of coal forming?
- late Paleozoic Era (specifically Carboniferous Period) 
The era that is means “Before Life”?  
- The Precambrian Era
What geologic period saw the most diverse animal class in an ancient ocean?  
- The Ordovician Era
Know what an angular unconformity is?  
- Essentially at a certain depth all terrain rotates its angel
What are the three principles of relative time?  
- Geological events must be put into a time perspective - The Geological Time Scale
- Relative age dating methods were used before numerical or absolute methods of dating were developed
- Only indicates the order of events relative to each other - not how long ago they occurred
What procedure is used to date rocks?  
- Radiometric dating (absolute dating) / relative dating
What is the difference between absolute and relative time?  
- Relative: determines which rocks are older and which are younger with respect to each other
- Absolute: Analysis of the breakdown of radioactive elements in the rocks over time
Is a dike younger or older than the rock it intrudes?
- A dike is younger than the rock it intrudes
# Fossils:
What are the two parts of a fossil called?  
- Mold and cast
What class of animal appeared from no where in the Cambrian Period?  
- Trilobite
What two agents are needed to occur for an animal to become a fossil?  
- Rapid burial and possession of hard parts increases the chances of preservation
What is the Pennsylvania state fossil?  
- Phacops
What is correlation in the geology terms?  
- Involves matching of rocks of similar ages from different regions - provides a more comprehensive view of the rock record
Which class of rock do most fossils form it?  
- Sedimentary rock
What mineral makes up many of the fossils?
- Calcite, iron, most likely silica
# Earthquakes:
Where is an epicenter located relative to the focus of an earthquake?  
- 
What scale is designed on people’s reaction?  
- 
The deepest earthquakes in the world are found where?  
- 
What chart is used to determine the distance from a seismic station?  
- 
Know what a P wave, S wave and surface wave are.  
- 
What is an earthquake scale that is based on the energy released during an event?
- 
Can earthquakes be associated with volcanic eruptions?  
- 
Name several end results of a major seismic event  
- 
What instrument records earthquakes?  
- 
What is paleoseismology?  
- 
How much difference in energy released is it from a magnitude 3.0 to a 4.0?
- 
# Geologic Maps:
What is a formation?  
Where is the oldest formation on a geologic map located on column?  
Recognize a strike and dip symbol.  
The angle that the rock is tilted into the Earth is its ___________________.  
How are faults shown on a geologic map?  
What is the sedimentary rock containing angular fragments found near Kelly Residence?  
What is the hard dense rock found on the Physical Fitness Trail near the Sewer Plant?
# Mountain Building: 
What is an arch-shaped fold called?  
What is a fault type that the hanging wall moves downward compared to the footwall?  
A mountain building event is known as a ________________________?  
A circular geologic feature that the oldest rock is found in the center?  
Type of fault that has horizontal movement?  
In a syncline, the youngest rocks are found along its axis.  
One example of a geologic feature involving compression, tensional and shearing.  
A fracture in the Earth where movement has occurred is a   
A low angle reverse fault is a _  
Name an example of a dome and fault-block mountain.  
The Appalachian Mountains are an example of what type of mountain?
