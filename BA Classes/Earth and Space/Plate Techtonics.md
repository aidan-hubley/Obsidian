# Alfred Wegener
1. November 1880 - November 1930
2. Was a German polar researcher, geophysicist and meteorologist who developed the first theory of continental drift and formulated the idea that supercontinent known as Pangaea existed on the Earth millions of years ago. His ideas were largely ignored at the time they were developed but today they are very well accepted by the scientific community. 
# Evidence from Climate
1. Wegener looked at certain areas on Earth and their climates
2. he noted that the fossils he found on certain sections of Earth did not match the current climate
3. Glacier scratches in S. Africa
# The Great Debate
1. Rejection of the drift hypothesis
	1. Main objection to Wegener's proposal was its inability to provide a mechanism
	2. There was also no evidence that the oceanic crust was weak enough to break as the continents moved
# The Theory of Plate Tectonics
1. Other evidence supported a new idea
	1. Seafloor mapping showed a global oceanic ridge system winding through the major oceans
	2. Earthquakes were occurring at great depths beneath deep-ocean trenches
	3. Youngest seafloor discovered was 180 million years old
	4. Sediment accumulations in ocean basins were thin
# 2 Types of Crust
1. Continental Crust
	1. Thick less dense that oceanic crust and mostly old
	2. About 25 miles (32 kilometers) thick under the continents
	3. Is mostly composed of Granite
2. Oceanic Crust
	1. Thin, dense - sinks under continental crust and young
	2. Is only about 3-5 miles (8 kilometers) thick under the oceans
	3. Is mostly composed of Basalt
# Divergent Plate Boundaries and Seafloor Spreading
1. Two plates move apart
2. Mantle materials upwells to create new seafloor
3. Ocean ridges and seafloor spreading
	1. Oceanic ridges develop along well-developed boundaries
	2. Along ridges, seafloors spreading creates new seafloor
4. Continental rifts form at spreading centers within a continent
# The Mid-Ocean Ridge
1. Hot mantle rock rises beneath the ridges a result of convention
2. This explains high heat flow and basaltic volcanic eruptions
3. Tension at the ridge crest results in cracking open of oceanic crust to for a rift valley
4. Shallow focus earthquakes
# Continental Rifting
1. A plume causes a dome that breaks in three-pronged pattern
2. The plume separates the crust along two of the three fractures
3. The third fracture become inactive and eventually fills with sediment called a failed rift or aulacogen
# How is Plate Motion Measured?
1. Ocean-drilling ships
	1. Age dates of seafloor
	2. Paleomagnetism
	3. Examination of long fracture zones
2. Using space-age technology to directly measure the relative motion of plates
	1. Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
	2. Global Positioning System (GPS)
# Testing the Plate Tectonics Model
1. Evidence: Ocean drilling
	1. Some of the most convincing evidence confirming seafloor spreading has come form drilling into ocean-floor sediment
		1. Age of deepest sediments
		2. Thickness of ocean-floor sediments verifies seafloor spreading
2. Evidence: Paleomagnetism
	1. Probably the most persuasive evidence
	2. Ancient magnetism persevere in rocks
	3. Paleomagnetic records
		1. Polar wandering
			1. Shows conflicting evidence in rocks of the same age
		2. Earth's magnetic field reversals
			1. Recorded in rocks as the form at oceanic ridges
# What is the Evidence for Sea-Floor Spreading?
1. Several types of evidence supported Hess's theory of sea-floor spreading: eruptions of molten material, magnetic strips in the rock of the ocean floor, and the ages of the rocks themselves
# Past Super's Before Rodinia
1. Vaalbara - 3.6-2.7 billion years ago
2. Ur - 3.1 billion years ago
3. Kenorland - 2.7 billion years ago
4. Artica - 2.5 billion years ago
5. Atlantica - 2.0 billion years ago
6. Columbia - 2.5 - 1.5 billion years ago
7. Rodinia - 1.2 billion years ago
# East Coast Orogenies
1. Grenville - 1 billion years ago - Building of Rodinia
2. Taconic -  440 - 420 million years ago - Island arc collision
3. Acadian - 375 - 325 million years ago - Crustal collision(s)
4. Alleghanian - 325 - 260 million years ago - Africa-NA
# Late Triassic Rifting
1. Atlantic ocean opens
2. 1st: N. America / Africa
3. 2nd: S. and N. America
