# Prefaced notes
- Composition of the Universe
	- Dark Matter 27%
	- Dark Energy 68%
	- Ordinary Matter 5%
		- 4% H and He
		- <1 % stars / other
- Started with a Big Bang Theory
	- 13.82 billions years ago (start of the Big Bang)
	- Quarks and Neutrons sent out a huge explosion
	- Christians believe God put the Big Bang into motion
- Hubble can see about 13.7 Billion years ago
- Normal galaxies formed around 1 billion years after the Big Bang
- Andromeda Galaxy is 2.8 million light years away
- We are not in the middle of our galaxy, in fact we are in the outer edge
	- It would take us 100,00 years going at light speed to make it to the center of our galaxy
# 12.1 What Makes Earth Habitable?
1. Exoplanet: Planets that orbit other stars
2. The Habitable Zone: Sufficient atmospheric pressure so liquid water can be maintained on the surface
	1. The right planet
		1. Correct size to support life as we know it
		2. Molten metallic core
		3. Plate tectonics
	2. The right location - distance from the Sun
	3. The right time
		1. Atmosphere has evolved over time
		2. Geologic events have shaped Earth
3. Small Exoplanets Found in the Habitable Zones of their Host Star
	1. Our sun is a yellow star
# 12.2 Birth of a Planet
1. The history of Earth began about 13.7 billion years ago with the Big Bang
	1. From the Big Bang to heavy elements
		1. Hydrogen and helium formed shortly after the Big Bang
		2. Heavier elements are created in stars
			1. A supernova event occurs when a star explodes and creates the heaviest elements
## Birth of a Planet
### From planetesimals to protoplanets
The solar system formed from a solar nebula (a rotating cloud of interstellar dust and gases) Most material condensed in the center of the solar nebula to form the protosun. Remaining debris formed a flattened disk rotating around the protosun. Repeated collisions of debris formed asteroid-sized planetesimals rotating around the protosun. 
### From planetesimals to protoplanets
Repeated collisions and accretions of the planetesimals formed protoplanets and moons. Earth's Moon formed from the collision of a Mars-sized object with Earth.
### Earth's Early evolution
Repeated collisions with planetesimals and the decay of radioactive elements caused Earth’s temperature to increase  
Hadean eon Iron and nickel melted and sank to form the metallic core, whereas less  
dense material rose to form the mantle and crust
# 12.3 Origin and Evolution of the Atmosphere and Oceans
1. Earth's primitive atmosphere, which consisted mainly of H2O vapor and C02 formed by a process called outgassing
	1. Gases trapped in the planet's interior are released by volcanic eruptions
	2. The process continues today
2. Water vapor condensed to form clouds and rainwater that formed the oceans
3. About 3.5 billion years ago, photosynthesizing bacteria began to release oxygen
	1. Oxygen levels steadily increased over time
	2. Eventually oxygen levels were sufficient for ozone to develop in the atmosphere, significant amounts recorded 2.3 billions years ago
## Origin of the Atmosphere and Ocean
### Outgassing evolved the Earth's oceans
Produced acidic conditions that caused an accelerated rate of  
weathering of Earth’s rocky surface. Products of this weathering were carried to the oceans, thus increasing  
the salinity of the oceans. Oceans also served as a depository for carbon dioxide. 541 million years ago, organisms extract in large quantities for shells
### Earth's Early Crust was Continually Recycled
The crust covering this lava lake is continually being replaced with fresh lava from below, much like the way Earth's crust was recycled early in its history.
