# 2.1 Minerals: Building Blocks of Rocks
1. Definition of a mineral
	1. Natural
	2. Inorganic
	3. Solid
	4. Possess an orderly internal structure of atoms
	5. Have a definite chemical composition

# 2.2 Atoms: Building Blocks of Minerals
1. Atoms 
	1. Smallest particles of matter
	2. Contains central nucleus with protons and neutrons
		1. Protons: dense particle with positive charge
		2. Neutrons: dense particle with neutral charge
	3. Electrons surround nucleus
		1. Negligible mass with negative charge
# Elements: Defined by Their Number of Protons
1. Atomic number
	1. Number of protons in the nucleus
	2. Determines chemical nature
2. Element
3. Periodic Table
# Why Atoms Bond
1. Valence shell
	1. An atoms's outermost shell of electrons
	2. Can be transferred to form chemical bonds
2. Octet rule
	1. Atoms gain, lose, or share electrons until their valence shells have 8 electrons
3. Chemical bond
	1. Transfer or sharing electrons to achieve full valence shell
# Ionic Bonds: Electrons Transferred
1. Ions
	1. Positively and negatively charged atoms
	2. Strongly attracted to each other
2. Ionic Bonding
	1. One atoms gives up one or more valence electrons
	2. Forms ionic compounds
# Covalent Bonds: Electrons Sharing
1. Covalent bonding
	1. No ions are present
	2. Sharing of valence electrons
# Metallic Bonds: Electrons Free to Move
1. Metallic bonding
	1. Contains ions
	2. Packed metal atoms have valence electrons free to move throughout the structure
# Mineral Strength
1. Mineral Strength: How easily minerals break or deform is determined by the bonds
	1. Hardness - ability to resist scratching or abrasion
	2. Cleavage - tendency to break along planes of weak bonding
	3. Fracture - random pattern of breakage
	4. Tenacity - resistance to cutting, breaking, bending, and deformation
2. Specific gravity - mineral density
# Other Properties of Minerals
1. Other properties: some minerals have other distinctive properties
	1. Taste
	2. Smell
	3. Elasticity
	4. Malleability
	5. Double refraction
	6. Magnetism
	7. Feel
	8. Reaction with hydrochloric acid
# Mineral Groups
1. Eight element compose most rock-forming minerals:
	1. Oxygen (O)
	2. Silicon (Si)
	3. Aluminum (Al)
	4. Iron (Fe)
	5. Calcium (Ca)
	6. Sodium (Na)
	7. Potassium (K)
	8. Magnesium (Mg)
2. Silicate Minerals
	1. Most common mineral group
	2. Contain silicon and oxygen
3. Common Light Silicate Minerals
	1. Light in color and less dense
	2.	Feldspar Group
		1.	Most plentiful
		2.	Potassium feldspar - rich in potassium ions
		3.	Plagioclase feldspar - contains both sodium and calcium ions that substitute for each other
	3.	Quartz
		1.	Second most abundant
		2.	Consists entirely of silicon and oxygen
		3.	Impurities make different colors
	4.	Common Dark Silicate Minerals
		1.	Dark in color and high specific gravity
		2.	Contains iron and / or magnesium
		3.	Olivine Group
			1.	Found in basalts in oceanic crust
			2.	Make up mantle rocks
		4.	Pyroxene group
			1.	Found in basalts
		5.	Amphibole group
			1.	Found in many igneous rocks
4.	Important Nonsilicate Minerals
	1.	Carbonates
	2.	Halides
	3.	Oxides
	4.	Sulfides
	5.	Sulfates
	6.	Native Elements
# Minerals: A Nonrenewable Resource
1. Renewable
	1. Can be replenished in relatively short time spans
		1. Corn, wind, water, etc
	2. Nonrenewable
		1. Earth has fixed quantities
			1. Oil, aluminum, natural gas, coal
# Mineral Resources and Ore Deposits
1. Minerals resources are occurrences of useful minerals that will eventually be extracted
2. Ore deposits are concentrations of metallic minerals that can be mined at a profit
3. Economic factors may change and influence a resource
# Resource from Rocks and Minerals
1. Metallic mineral resources
	1. Gold, silver, copper, mercury, lead, etc.
	2. Produced by Igneous and Metamorphic processes 
	3. Most important ore deposits are generated from hydrothermal (hot-water)solution
		1. Regmatites: form fluid-rich environment, have unusually large crystals
		2. Vein deposits in fractures or bedding planes
		3. Disseminated deposits that are distributed throughout the rock
	# Nonmetallic Mineral Resources
	1. Make use of the material's
		1. Nonmetallic elements 
		2. Physical and/or chemical properties
	2. Two broad groups
		1. Building materials (e.g. limestone, gypsum)
		2. Industrial minerals (e.g. fluorite, corundum, sylvite)
	# Energy Resources
	1. Coal
		1. Burns energy stored by plants millions of years ago
		2. Air pollution, Surface scarring
	2. Oil and Natural Gas
		1. More than 60 percent of US consumed energy
		2. Remains of marine plants and animals
		3. Source rock - where oil and nature gas originate
		4. Oil trap - geologic environment allowing oil and gas to accumulate
	# Hydraulic Fracturing ("Fracking")
	1. Shale deposits contains reservoirs of oil and gas
	2. Rocks are cracked below ground to facilitate extraction
