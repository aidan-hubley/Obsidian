# 11.1 A Brief History of Geology
1. Catastrophism
	1. Landscape developed by catastrophes
	2. James Ussher, mid-1600s, concluded Earth was only a few thousand years old
2. Modern geology
	1. Uniformitarianism
		1. Fundamental principle of geology
		2. "The present is the key to the past" - James Hutton
# 11.2 Creating a Time Scale: Relative Dating Principles
1. The importance of a time scale
	1. Rocks records geologic and evolutionary changes throughout Earthâ€™s history
	2. Without a time perspective, these events have very little meaning
2. Numerical and relative dates
	1. Numerical dates specify the number of years that have passed since an event occurred
		1. Example: The limestone is 250 million years old
	2. Relative dates place rocks in a sequence of formation
		1. Example: The Hermit Shale is older than the Coconino Sandstone	
## Methods of Dating Rocks
1. **Relative Dating**
	1. Using fundamental principles of geology to determine the **relative age**
	2. Determining which rocks are older and which are younger with respect to each other
2. **Absolute Dating**
	1. Quantifying the actual date of the rock in years via **radiometric dating**
	2. Analysis of the breakdown of radioactive elements in the rocks over time
## Numerical Dating with Nuclear Decay
1. Radiometric Dating
	1. Uses the decay of isotopes in rocks to calculate the age of that rock
2. Half-life
	1. A half-life is the amount of time required for half of the radioactive isotope to decay
		1. Radioactive parent isotopes decay to stable daughter isotopes
		2. When the ratio of parent to daughter is 1:1, one half-life had passed
# 11.6 Determining Numerical Dates for Sedimentary Strata
1. Sedimentary rocks can rarely be dated directly by radiometric means
	1. Geologists must rely on igneous rocks in the strata
		1. Radiometric dating determines the age of the igneous rocks
		2. Relative dating techniques assign date ranges to sedimentary rocks
## Relative Dating: Principles of Geology
1. Geologic events must be put into a time perspective - the **Geologic Time Scale**
2. **Relative age dating** methods were used before **numerical** or **absolute** methods of dating were developed:
	1. Principle of Original Horizontality
	2. Principle of Lateral Continuity
	3. Law of Superposition
	4. Principle of Cross-Cutting Relationships
	5. Inclusions
	6. Unconformities (Disconformity, Non-Conformity, Angular Unconformity)
	7. Principle of Fossil Succession
	8. Index Fossils
	9. Uniformitarianism
3. Only indicates the order of events relative to each other - not how long ago they occurred
## Creating a Time Scale: Relative Dating Principles
1. Unconformities
	1. Layers of rock that have been deposited without interruption are called conformable layers
	2. An unconformity is a break in the rock record produced by nondeposition and erosion of rock units
		1. Three basic types: angular unconformity, nonconformity, disconformity
# 11.2 Fossils: Evidence of Past Life
1. Fossils are traces or remains of prehistoric life preserved in rock
2. Paleontology is the study of fossils
3. Knowing the nature of life that exited at a particular time helps researchers understand past environmental conditions
## Types of Fossils
1. Permineralization
	1. Mineral-rich groundwater flows through porous tissue and precipitates minerals
	2. Example: petrified wood
2. Molds and casts
	1. a mold is created when a shell is buried and then dissolved by underground water
	2. A cast is created when the hollow space of a mold are filled
3. Carbonization and Impressions
	1. Carbonization happens when an organism is buried, followed by compression, which squeezes out gases and liquids leaving a thin film of carbon
		1. Effective at preserving leaves and delicate animals
	2. Impressions remain in the rock when the carbon film is lost
4. Amber
	1. Amber is the hardened resin of ancient trees
		1. Effective at preserving insects
2. Trace Fossils
	1. Indirect evidence of prehistoric life
		1. Includes tracks, burrows, coprolites, and gastroliths
3. Conditions favoring preservation
	1. Most organisms are not preserved
	2. Rapid burial and the possession of hard parts increases the chances of preservation
## Correlation of Rock Layers
1. Fossils and Correlation 
	1. Principles of fossil succession
		1. The principles of fossil succession states that fossils are arranged according to their age
			1. Example: Age of Trilobites, Age of Fishes, Age of Reptiles, Age of Mammals
		2. Index fossils and fossil assemblages
			1. Index fossils are widespread geographically and limited to a short period of geologic time
			2. Used to determine a rock's age
## Index Fossils
1. Certain fossils are found only in the rock layers of a particular geological age
2. These are known as INDEX FOSSILS
# 11.3 Correlation of Rock Layers
1. Correlation involves matching of rocks of similar ages from different regions
2. Correlation provides a more comprehensive view of the rock record
