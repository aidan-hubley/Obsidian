# 6.1 Mount St. Helens Versus Kilauea
1. Mount St. Helens, Washington
	1. 1980, Largest historic eruption
2. Kilauea, Hawai'i
	1. Began in 1983, the most recent of at least 50 eruptive phases
# 6.2 The Nature of Volcanic Eruptions
1. Magma: Source Material for Volcanic Eruptions
	1. Composition
		1. Basaltic (mafic): rich in dark silicates
		2. Granitic (felsic): rich in light silicates
	2. Where magma is generated
		1. Basaltic: results form partial melting of upper mantle
		2. Granitic: results from melting of continental crust
2. Effusive versus explosive eruptions are controlled by:
	1. Viscosity: the resistance to flow
		1. Higher silica content = higher viscosity
		2. Higher viscosity are more explosive
	2. Gas content: amount of dissolved gases present in magma
		1. Higher viscosity have more trapped gases = more explosive
# 6.3 Materials Extruded During an Eruption
1. Lava flows
	1. Basaltic lavas are much more fluid
		1. Pahoehoe lava (resembles a twisted or ropey texture)
		2. Aa lava (rough, jagged blocky texture)
		3. Pillow lavas (occurring along divergent plate boundaries on the ocean floor)
	2. Andesitic/Rhyolite lavas are viscous
		1. Block lavas (rough, travel short distances)
2. Dissolved gases
	1. One to six percent of a magma by weight
	2. Mainly water vapor and carbon dioxide
3. Pyroclastic material (fire fragments)
	1. Ash and dust: fine, glassy fragments
	2. Pumice: porous rock from "frothy" lava
	3. Lapilli: walnut-sized material
	4. Cinders: pea-sized material
	5. Blocks: hardened or cooled lava
	6. Bombs: ejected as hot lava
# 6.4 Anatomy of a Volcano
1. General features
	1. Opening at the summit of a volcano
		1. Crater: steep-walled depression at the summit, generally less than 1 kilometer in diameter
		2. Caldera: a summit depression typically greater than 1 kilometer in diameter, produced by collapse following a massive eruption
	2. Vent: opening connected to the magma chamber via a pipe
# 6.5 Shield Volcanoes
1. General features
	1. Largest volcanoes
	2. Broad, slighty dome-shaped
	3. Basaltic lava
	4. Mild eruptions of large volumes of lava
	5. Most begin on the ocean floor (called seamounts)
# 6.6 Cinder Cones
1. General features
	1. Built form ejected basaltic lava (mainly cinder-sized) fragments, forming a steep slope
	2. Small size and frequently occur in groups
# 6.7 Composite Volcanoes
1. General features
	1. Large, classic-shaped volcano (thousands of feet high and several miles wide at base)
	2. Composed of interbedded lava flows and layers of pyroclastic debris
	3. Violent eruptions
	4. Most are located adjacent to the Pacific Ocean (e.g. Fujiyama, Mount St. Helens)
# 6.8 Volcanic Hazards
1. Pyroclastic flow
	1. Fiery pyroclastic flow made of hot gases infused with ash and other debris
	2. Driven by gravity down the slopes of a volcano at speeds up to 200 kilometers per hour
	3. Destroyed the ancient city of Pompeii
2. Lahar
	1. Mudflow from interaction with debris and water
	2. Follow stream valleys
3. Tsunamis: triggered from collapse of volcanic landforms in the ocean
4. Volcanic Ash and Aviation: clouds of volcanic ash damage planes
5. Volcanic Gas and Respiratory Health: poisonous gases can be inhaled
6. Effects on Climate: dust and gas can significantly alter global temperatures
# 6.9 Other Volcanic Landforms
1. Calderas
	1. Steep-walled depressions that are generally larger than 1 kilometer
	2. Form from either:
		1. Collapse of an empty magma chamber
		2. Collapse of the top of a shield volcano from subterranean drainage
		3. Collapse of a large area from discharge of large volumes of pumice and ash
2. Fissure eruptions and basalt plateaus
	1. Fluid basaltic lava extruded from crustal fractures called fissures
	2. Example: Columbia River Plateau
3. Volcanic necks
	1. Volcanic necks are resistant vents left standing after erosion has removed the volcanic cone
	2. Example: Ship Rock, New Mexico
# 6.10 Intrusive Igneous Activity
1. Intrusive (plutons): magma rises through crust
2. Tabular Intrusive Bodies: magma forcibly injected into a fracture zone or bedding plane
	1. Dikes: cuts across bedding surfaces
	2. Sills: travel along bedding planes
3. Massive Intrusive Bodies: large amounts of intruded material
	1. Batholiths
		1. Largest intrusive bodies
		2. Occur as long, linear features, often under mountain ranges
	2. Stocks
		1. Smaller pluton
	3. Laccoliths
		1. Forcibly injected between strata
		2. Can cause strata on top to rise
