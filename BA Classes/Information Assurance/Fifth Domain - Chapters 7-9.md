Hello my name is Aidan Hubley and today I'm going to share a couple of my takeaways from chapters 7 through 9 in the book the Fifth Domain.

# Chapter #7
1. My first takeaway from Chapter 7 is that although Clinton, Bush, and Obama rejected, or declined to establish a federal cybersecurity regulatory regime, there is a mountain of cybersecurity regulation created by federal agencies. Banks, nuclear power plants, self-driving cars. Variation in federal regulations should be a result of conscious policy choices, not the incremental accretion of rules written at different times with little central guidance. It is time to step back and assess which of these agencies and regulations have been effective.

2. Secondly, the book made this point: "Trying to force companies with bad cybersecurity out of business should not be the goal. Nonetheless, we think companies should have to prove that they have the resources to pay those fines." To me this makes sense, cybersecurity should not be necessary for business, however in my perspective you should be prepared to pay fines for not having it.

# Chapter #8
1. First takeaway from chapter 8 that passwords are a problem. The book says "The problem of passwords wonâ€™t go away until some combination of two things happen: multifactor authentication without a password is forced on companies and their customers, or multifactor authentication becomes something that takes place seamlessly in the background." after reading this chapter I am very curious to see the evolution of Multifactor authentication as it begins to take place in the background.
2. I was shocked to read "When identity proofing is needed online, almost all websites rely on the tried-and-failed method of validating historical information about you. With your address, your phone number, your date of birth, and your Social Security number, you can file your tax return." This has led to an uncountable amount of cases of fraud.

# Chapter #9
1. A Cyber Census was created by NIST to to show the cybersecurity workforce and job openings called Cyberseek. "NIST calculates the total cyber workforce in the United States at 768,096 people. NIST helpfully calculated that for every 2.5 people employed in cybersecurity, there is one additional opening." The impressive and honestly useful natural of Cyberseek goes on and on but I am mostly impressed with the stats that it was able to provide. It shows that the demand for employees is not at an entry level position. The market wants more midcareer, experienced professionals.
2. Finally, I was was very interested and excited to hear that a conclusion was made that the next President should create a national cybersecurity apprenticeship program with the goal of training fifty thousand new cybersecurity practitioners by 2020. While this has not been acted on, it surely peeked the interest of the private sector. 

That concludes my takeaways from chapter 9. Thank you for your time and attention. I hope you enjoyed this, have a good day.
