# Software Quality
## Word "Engineer"
Individual who has been educated in the History, Theory, Methods Practices... of engineering discipline.

***Software Engineering* is the study of the techniques and theory that underline the development of high-quality software**
## Ultimately
We want to satisfy the *Client*
The person or organization who pays for the software to be developed.
## Goals of Software Engineering
1. Solve the right problem
2. Deliver a solution on time and under budget
3. Deliver a high-quality solution
4. Accomplish it all in an ethical manner
## Characteristics that define the quality of a software
1.  Correctness
	1.  The degree to which software adheres to its specific requirements
		1.  Addressing problem
		2.  Providing accurate solution
2.  Reliability
	1.  The frequency and criticality of Software Failure
		1.  **A Software failure can be defined as any unacceptable behavior that occurs within permissible operating conditions**
		2.  A reliable software seldom fails, and when it does, it minimizes the effort of that failure
3.  Robustness
	1.  The degree to which erroneous situations are handled gracefully
4.  Usability
	1.  The ease with which users can learn and execute tasks within the software
5.  Maintainability
	1.  The ease with which changes can be made to the software
	2.  A poor documentation kills a project
	3.  Fix error
	4.  The software engineers who perform maintenance tasks are often not the same ones as those who originally developed the software
6.  Reusability
	1.  The ease with which software components can be reused in the development of other software systems
7.  Portability
	1.  The ease with which software components can be used in multiple computer environments
8.  Efficiency
	1.  The degree to which the software fulfills its purpose without using excess resources.
