# Trees
1. A tree is a non-linear structure in which elements are organized inot a hierarchy
2. A tree is comprised of a set of nodes in which elements are stored and edges connect one node to another
3. Each node is located on a particular level
4. There is only one root node in the tree
5. Nodes at the lower level of a tree are the **children** of nodes at the previous level
6. A node can have only one **parent**, but may have multiple children
7. Nodes that have the same parent are **siblings**
8. The root is the only node which has no parent
9. A node that has no children is a **leaf** node
10. A node that is not the root and has at least one child is an **internal node**
11. A **subtree** is a tree structure that makes up part of another tree
12. We can follow a path through a tree from parent to child, starting at the root
13. A node is an ancestor of another node if it is above it on the path from the root
14. Nodes that can reached by following a path from a particular node are the **descendants** of that node
15. The **level** of a node is the length of the oath from the root to the node
16. The **path length** is the number of edges followed to get from the root to the node
17. The height of a tree is the length of the longest path form the root to a leaf
## Classifying Trees
1. Trees can be classified in many ways
2. One important criterion is the **maximum number of children** any node in that tree may have
3. This may be referred to as the **order** of the tree
## Balanced Trees
1. Trees in which nodes may have at most two children are called binary trees
2. A tree is **balanced** if all of the leaves of the tree are on the same level or within one level of each other
## Implementing Trees
1. Linked List
2. Arrays
### Computed Child Links
1. For full or complete binary trees, we can use an array to represent a tree
2. For any element stored in position n,
	1. The elements left child is stored in array position (2n + 1)
	2. The elements right child is stored in array position (2 * (n + 1))
3. If the represented tree is not complete or relatively complete, this approach can be waste large amounts of array space
### Tree Traversals
1. For linear structures, the process of iterating through the elements is fairly obvious (forwards or backwards)
2. For non-linear structures like a tree, the possibilities are more interesting
3. Let's look at four classic ways of traversing the nodes of a tree
4. All traversal **start at the root** of the tree
#### Four ways
1. Preorder
	1. Visit the rood, then traverse the subtrees from left to right
2. Inorder
	1. Traverse the left subtree, then visit the root, then traverse the right subtree
3. Postorder
	1. Traverse the subtrees from left to right, then visit the root
4. Level-order
	1. Visit each node at each level of the tree form top (root) to bottom and left to right
