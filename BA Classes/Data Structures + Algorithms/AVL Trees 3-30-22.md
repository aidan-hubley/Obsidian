# AVL Trees
1. An AVL tree (named after the creators) ensures a BST stays balanced
	1. Andelson-Velsky and Landis
2. For each node in the tree, there is a numeric balance factor - the difference between the heights of its subtrees
3. After each add or removal, the balance factors are checked, and rotations performed as needed
4. Balance factor should be -1 or 0 or 1
