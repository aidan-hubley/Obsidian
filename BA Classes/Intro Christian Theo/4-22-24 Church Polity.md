--- There is no church government structure that is mandated by the New Testament

# Presuppositions
- Polity = church government.  
- Issue = where in the church does authority reside (under God) and how is that authority to be exercised?
- No form is mandated in the NT.  
- All models of polity can find some basis in NT practice.

- Baptist perspective tend to  
	- Elevate congregational autonomy.  
	- Explain away apostolic authority.  
	- Allow for an “associational impulse.”  
	- This doesn’t do justice to the NT.  
	- Congregational autonomy is an anachronism in the NT.  
- Our culture has democratic presuppositions about the church.

# Membership
- In the first century baptism = membership.  
	- Early practice: immediate believer baptism.  
	- Later: catechetical period before baptism.  
	- Later: infant baptism with later confirmation.  
- Formal church membership developed as a result of denominations.  
- Grenz gives a theological rationale for it.  
	- Important for independent congregationalism.  
	- But it borrows some meaning from baptism.
- Membership: is it necessary in our context?  
	- What about individualism and avoidance accountability.  
- In a congregation that practices believer baptism, how should membership should be connected to it?

# Forms of Church Government
- Episcopal  
	- From episkopos, bishop.  
	- Catholic, Orthodox, Episcopal, Methodist.  
	- Bishops have greater authority.  
- Supervise other clergy.  
- Pastoral placement and discipline.  
- Ordination.  
	- Catholic and Anglican: apostolic succession.  
	- May be degrees of ordination

- Highest claim for the authority of the bishop is papal infallibility (Roman Catholicism).  
	- When pope speaks ex cathedra (“from the chair” - in the authority of his office) on matters of faith and doctrine, he is infallible.  
	- Only two dogmas: Immaculate Conception (1854) and Bodily Assumption (1950) of Mary.

- Presbyterian  
	- From presbuteros, elder.  
	- Reformed, Presbyterian.  
	- Series of representative assemblies whose decisions are binding on those below them.
	- Teaching elders (clergy) vs. ruling elders (lay).  
	- Only one level of clergy.

- Congregationalism (“independent”)  
	- Authority in congregation; self-governing.  
	- Baptists, Congregationalists, most Lutherans.  
	- Every member has a voice in decisions. 
	- Usually elder/bishop = pastor.  
	- Congregation calls pastor, elects officers.  
	- Local church may ordain or may call to ordination, with denominational elders ordaining.  
	- Larger group is “fellowship,” “convention,” etc.  
	- Brethren: limited congregational.

- These forms correspond to political models.  
	- Episcopal = monarchy.  
	- Presbyterian = republic.  
	- Congregational = democracy.  
- Polity has reflected the dominant political system of the time.  
	- Medieval monarchies = episcopal polity.  
	- Swiss cantons, British parliament (representative government) = presbyterianism.
	- Modern US = congregationalism.

- These forms have had class affiliations.  
	- Episcopal = upper class.  
	- Presbyterian = middle class.  
	- Congregational = lower class.  
- Nongovernment approach (M. Erickson)  
	- Downplay visible organization or structure.  
	- Quakers, Plymouth Brethren.  
	- Stress Spirit’s role in working with everyone.

- Congregational churches may have different internal organizations.  
	- They’re self-governing, can create their own structures.  
	- They don’t have to be democratic locally.

- Principles of church organization:  
	- Importance of order.  
	- Priesthood of all believers.  
	- Recognition and use of spiritual gifts.  
	- Mutuality and servanthood.  
	- Leadership equips all members for ministry.  
	- There are very few pure forms of church polity!

# Leadership in the Church
- Many functions recognized in NT.  
- Apostle (from “to send”): sent to preach gospel, found churches.  
- Bishop/overseer and elder: oversight of local congregations.  
- Bishop = supervisory role.  
- Elder = leadership, spiritual oversight (older people).  
- Plural eldership in NT.

- Leaders in NT: “apostles and elders.”  
- Deacons  
	- Service to and/or leadership of churches.  
	- Not clear how they differed from elders.  
	- Serve variety of functions today
- Also prophets, evangelists, pastors, teachers in NT.  
	- Apostles, prophets, deacons were female.  
	- Perhaps female heads of household were elders.

- Leadership structures in NT are flexible.  
	- People called to variety of functions.  
	- Many traditions today have only one: pastor. 
	- More emphasis on function than on office.  
	- Based on gifts, calling, character.  
- Ancient Catholic threefold ministry:  
	- Bishop, elder, deacon (by early 2nd century).  
	- Bishops became guarantors of orthodoxy.  
	- Developed into apostolic succession

- Catholicism: ordination became sacrament that conferred indelible character on recipient.  
	- Imparts “a spiritual power or capacity in regard to the sacred and divine things possessed by the church” (K. Rahner).  
	- Can’t be lost under any circumstances.  
	- Ontological distinction between priest and lay. 
	- Protestants: priesthood of all believers.

# Ordination
- Ordination = formally setting someone apart for leadership in the community.  
- Should be understood as the community giving their “Amen” to the perception of God’s call.  
	- Done with prayer and laying on of hands.  
	- Involves divine call, community confirmation.  
- Modern practices are far from the NT.  
	- NT: set apart for various functions.  
	- Now: carefully regulated, ordination distinguished from other types of “setting apart."

- Conceptual change occurred when church switched from Greek to Latin.
	- Greek: cheirotonein (“appointment,” from word meaning to extend the hand).
	- Latin: ordo, ordinare (from Roman law, special status distinct from the plebs - ordo clarissimus = Roman Senate).
	- Shift from functional to ontological concept.

- Disagreements about the offices, qualifications, and meaning of ordination.  
	- Who is ordained? Pastors only? Bishops, elders, deacons? Clergy and lay? Women?
	- Catholicism, Anglicans: apostolic succession.  
	- Most Protestants: confirmation of God’s call.  
- “Baptism is the sign of our universal ordina-tion” (Grenz). All are called to minister.  
- Within that, some are called to leadership.

- Protestants deny that ordination confers a special character on the recipient.
	- Clergy aren’t ontologically different from laity.  
	- Not set above the community, but placed in leadership of the community

Who has authority to ordain?  
• Christ ordains.  
• How his ordination is expressed shows how his authority is mediated in the  
church.  
• Symbolized by who lays hands on candidate.  
• Episcopal = bishop.  
• Presbyterian = presbytery.  
• Congregational = congregation or its representatives.  
• Brethren = hybrid system.

Should women be ordained?  
• Ordination isn’t at issue in any of the restrictive passages in the NT.  
• We have reduced all NT offices to one.  
• Offices in the NT seem to be based on gifts.  
• Ministry in the NT is not a priesthood.  
• Ministry in the NT is not about having authority over others but about  
servanthood.  
• Like the disciples, we keep arguing about who gets to be in charge!
