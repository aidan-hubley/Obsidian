--- The Doctrine of Sin ---

# Is this Necessary?
- Our society rejects the category of sin.
- Considered to be judgmental, intolerant today.  
- Some preach on sin to incite hatred.  
- Guilt redefined (post-Freud) as guilt feelings.  
- Do we teach “sin management”?

## Gospel of Sin Management (Dallas Willard)
- 2 Different GSMs  
- Left and right  
- Both have a gospel, a vision of the what is good.
- Right – forgiveness of sins 
- Left – eradication of structural (social) evils 
- Neither includes in its sense of the gospel the transformation of life and character.

- Dallas Willard, argued that the Church today teaches “sin management” by which he meant that if it weren’t for sin, we wouldn’t need God.
- Was Jesus ultimate focus the forgiveness of sin?
- Dallas Willard would say, “No.” 
- He would say that Jesus came to give us life.  
- I would add, to declare and introduce the Kingdom of God.
- Does the gospel I preach and teach (and live) have a natural tendency to cause people who hear it to become full-time students of Jesus?  
- Would those who believe it become his apprentices as a natural “next step”?  
- What can we reasonably expect would result from people actually believing the substance of my message?  
- Willard, Dallas. The Divine Conspiracy, 68.

- Our society rejects the category of sin.  
- Considered to be judgmental, intolerant today.  
- Some preach on sin to incite hatred.

- Karl Menninger, Whatever Became of Sin?

## Karl Menninger
- "Clergy have a golden opportunity to prevent some of the accumulated misapprehension, guilt, aggressive action, and other roots of later mental suffering and mental disease. How? Preach! Tell it like it is. Say if from the pulpit. Cry it from the housetops."
- What shall we cry? Cry comfort, cry repentance, cry hope. Because recognition of our part in the world transgression is the only remaining hope.”


- Eugene Peterson: Seeing people as sinners isn’t judgmental but a theological truth.  
- Balanced doctrine of sin can help explain the paradoxical human condition.  
- Created in the image of God, capable of great achievements and extraordinary good.  
- Fallen sinners, reflecting the character of their “father” the devil, capable of unthinkable evil.

# Sin's Nature
--- What is Sin? ---

## The Nature of Sin
- Sin is
	- Disobedience to God (Gen 3.6)
	- A transgression of a law of God (1 John 3.4)
	- Any unrighteousness (1 John 5.17)
- Words can be sinful (Prov. 10.19)
- Thoughts can be sinful (Rom 14.23)
- Unbelief can be sinful (Rom 14.23)
- At its most basic sense, sin is “missing the mark” or “failing to reach it.”  
- Suggestions: sensuality, selfishness, idolatry, pride, discontent, finitude.  
- Biblical words suggest failure to live up to God’s standards.  
- We can sin by commission or omission.
- Neglecting to do that which is good is sin (Jam 4.17)
	- 17 If anyone, then, knows the good they ought to do and doesn’t do it, it is sin for them.  
- Could it be that the omission of good words and thoughts is also worthy of guilt?

- Biblical words: violation of divine standards, rebellion, ignorance or error, unfaithfulness, evil.
- Most frequent words = chatha, hamartia.

- The Bible’s language on sin can be divided into 3 categories  
- Legal  
- Relational  
- Cultic

### The Nature of Sin: Legal
- Most common to Western way of thinking.  
- Sin is breaking God’s law.  
- Sinners are guilty before God.  
- Gen. 2.16-17  
- Rom. 1.18-3.20

### The Nature of Sin: Relational
- Sin is what harms relationships  
- Jesus’ summary of the Law is to Love God and neighbor.  
- Sin undermines relationships and if left unchecked irreparably severs them.  
- Words here are alienation, separation, hostility, unfaithfulness, idolatry.  
- Parapiptein and adikia

### The Nature of Sin: Cultic
- Drawing on the Temple imagery and language, we understand that  
- Sin is defilement and uncleanness 
- This defilement pollutes us  
- Where the other 2 are external, this one is internal.

## Kinds of Sin
- What is the difference of sinful acts  
	- Intentional  
	- Habitual  
	- Surprise  
- Is there any difference?  
- Is any worse/better than the others?
- “Mortal” vs. “venial” sins (Catholic)  
	- Mortal sins leads to spiritual death  
	- Venial ones weaken us.  
- “Seven Deadly Sins”: pride, envy, wrath, lust, avarice (greed), gluttony, sloth.  
- How appropriate is a distinction in sin?  
- We will say more about the “7-deadlies” in the future.

## Other Views of Sin
- Western Church: crime and punishment.  
- Eastern (Orthodox) Church: disease and healing.  
- Eastern (Orient): shame and honor

# Origin of Sin

## Causes of Sin
- The World: system of evil, under the direction of the devil, which is organized in opposition to Christ, the believer, and the church.
- The flesh: our own desires, springing from our sinful nature.  
- The devil: spiritual forces of evil.


- Volitional view (Augustine): misuse of free will. People choose to act, think, speak in accordance with their own will rather than God’s 
- Ignorance view (Pelagius): we don’t know any better.
- Soul-making view (Irenaeus): necessary for growth and maturity.  
- Existential view (Niebuhr): anxiety of finiteness or any limitation. The attempt to gain a sense of security often occurs at the expense of relationships (God and others)

- Augustine > Monosynergism 
	- Original Sin (is guilt but also you're born with sin)
	- Human can never get to God
- Wesley / Arminianism
	- **Prevenient Grace** (Grace at work before us)  
	- Semi Augustine > Synergism
		- God has moved on your behalf
	- Semi Pelagius > Synergism
		- Human has moved closer to God first
- Pelagius > Monosynergism
	- Theoretically, human could get to God with His help

- Paul traced sin to Adam (Rom. 5:12).  
- Theologians express this as original sin.  
	- First sin (Adam and Eve).  
	- Fundamental problem shared by all human beings (underneath specific acts of sin).

- Early church affirmed universality of sin.  
- Augustine fully develops original sin idea.  
	- We were in Adam when he sinned.  
	- Humans are now a “lump of perdition.”  
	- Augustine starts from infant baptism.  
- Legal imputation idea developed in Reformation (impute Adam’s guilt to all people).  
- Bondage of the will; total depravity.

- Theories of transmission of original sin: 
- Federal headship (from foedus, covenant)  
	- Legal relationship (Reformed).  
	- We’re bound by God’s covenant with Adam.  
	- Goes with creationist view of the soul.  
- Natural or realistic headship (solidarity)  
	- Biological (Augustine misread Romans 5:12).  
	- We were in Adam when he sinned.  
	- Goes with traducianist view of soul.

- Any theory that explains how sin gets from Adam to everybody is speculation!  
- Debate over what original sin consists of: 
	- Judicial guilt  
	- Inherited corruption  
	- Individual acts  
- Age of accountability?

- Infant Baptism is just Infant Dedications with water

- Pelagianism denied guilt and corruption 
	- Moral concern; stressed free will.  
	- Humanity has no corruption or guilt from Fall.  
	- People can obey God by their own efforts.  
	- Condemned at Council of Ephesus 431, Synod of Orange 529.  
- Arminianism affirms inherited corruption.  
	- We inherit corrupt nature, so we sin.  
	- Prevenient grace removes guilt of original sin.
- Anabaptism: Christ paid for original sin  
	- Adam/Christ parallel suggests that Christ’s work affected everyone in some way.  
	- Christ removed guilt of original sin for all.  
	- We still inherit corrupt nature and commit sins.  
- Calvinism-legal imputation of guilt.  
	- Adam sinned, so we’re guilty.  
	- We’re also corrupt, and we sin, so we’re more guilty.

# Extend of Sin

## Unpardonable Sin
- Matt. 12.31-32
- Mark 3.28-29 
- Luke 12.10

## Extent of Sin
- Traditionally humanity’s relationship to sin has been described in four stages: 
- Creation: posse (non) peccare (able (not) to sin)  
	- Fall: non posse non peccare (not able not to sin)
	- Redemption: posse non peccare (able not to sin)
	- Consummation: non posse peccare (not able to sin)

- Typological View (historical person who symbolizes certain truths)  
- Pelagian View (bad example)  
- Traditional View (original sin)  
	- How does it get transferred?  
	- Federal headship  
	- Solidarity view

- Sin is Universal (Rom 3.23)  
- Personal, but not private  
- Corporate  
- Structural

## Structured Sin
- Concept emerged from Latin American liberation theology in the 1960s and 1970s as a way to describe the dehumanizing conditions experienced by the continent’s poor.
- “It is significant that the early liberation theologians drew on a structuralist economic analysis of Latin American life, in contrast to the orthodox economic view that social life is an aggregate of individual behavior. Indeed, the function of the theological concept of “structural sin” is to name those death- dealing conditions which cannot be reduced to individual sinfulness, but rather shape the situations in which individuals make decisions.” – Matthew Shadle

## Is it a helpful category?
- Roman Catholics have done much better than Protestants contemplating these matters. But Popes like JP2 and Francis generally avoid using the term.  
- Can structures themselves do things?

## Some Structural Sins
- Racism  
- Caste system  
- Bribery or protection money  
- Human Trafficking and slavery

- What causes structural sin?  
- Who is guilty?  
- Who is innocent?  
- When is the line crossed?  
- How does it change?

- Seduction of Power  
- “What makes the temptation of power so seemingly irresistible? Maybe it is that power offers an easy substitute for the hard task of love. It seems easier to own life than to love life. Jesus asks, “Do you love me?” We ask, “Can we sit at your right hand and your left in your kingdom?” . . . We have been tempted to replace love with power.”
- Henri Nouwen, Mornings with Henre J. M. Nouwen”
