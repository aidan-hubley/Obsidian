# Method in Christology
- Christology from above vs from below:
	- From above: start with Jesus' deity
	- From below: start with his historical life
- Should we base our Christology on history, or should we affirm it only by faith?  
	- Jesus of history (Jesus as he really was).  
	- Christ of faith (the Christ proclaimed by the church).  
	- Led to the Quests for the Historical Jesus.  
- Whenever we try to go behind the Gospels to reconstruct Jesus, we make him in our own image.
- Functional vs. ontological Christology:  
	- Functional: focus on his role, what he did.  
	- Ontological: focus on his nature or being.

## "Career" of Jesus
- Significant events in Jesus’ career:  
	- Conception and birth as fulfillment of prophecy  
	- Flight to Egypt; childhood awareness of God  
	- Baptism; temptation; intimacy with God  
	- Ministry: teaching, healing, exorcism  
	- Transfiguration  
	- Triumphal entry into Jerusalem; Passion  
	- Resurrection; ascension; session and reign  
	- Intercession; return in glory; judgment

# Biblical Images
- Jesus’ death is an example (Phil. 2:3-8).  
- It’s a ransom (Mark 10:45).  
- It’s a victory (Col. 2:15).  
- It covers sin (Rom. 3:25-26).  
- It reconciles us to God (Rom. 5:10-11).  
- It’s a sacrifice (Heb. 9:6-15).

Expiation or propitiation?  
- Hilasterion  
	- Rom. 3.24-25  
		- 24 and all are justified freely by his grace through the redemption that came by Christ Jesus. 25 God presented Christ as a sacrifice of atonement,[i] through the shedding of his blood—to be received by faith. He did this to demonstrate his righteousness, because in his forbearance he had left the sins committed beforehand unpunished—  
	- Heb 9.5
		- 5 Above the ark were the cherubim of the Glory, overshadowing the atonement cover (mercy seat).
- Propitiation = turn away someone’s wrath.  
- Expiation = cover sins. (C.H. Dodd)  
	- Romans 1 shows God’s wrath in action.  
	- 24 Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.
	- 26 Because of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.  
	- 28 so God gave them over to a depraved mind, so that they do what ought not to be done.

- NT uses many images to express atonement.  
	- J. Driver: No single image can capture the full meaning of Christ’s work.  
	- Images are powerful expressions of a reality that we can’t fully express rationally.  
- How well do the various theories of the atonement account for the biblical images?
