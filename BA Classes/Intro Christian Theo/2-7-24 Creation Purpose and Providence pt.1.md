# Creation: Purpose and Providence
- Creation
- Providence
- The sovereignty of God
- The problem of evil
- Spiritual "Co-creations"

# Creation
- Doctrine of creation explores the relationship between God and the world
- This is expressed as "creator" and "creation"
- Doctrine of creation isn't deism
- Doctrine of providence contradicts deism
- Creation shows that God is relational

- Important Elements of the Doctrine of Creation
	- Creation is a free act
	- God created ex nihilo (out of nothing)
	- Creation is an act of God's love
	- God created by his word
	- God created everything
	- Creation is the work of the Trinity
	- Creation is for God's glory
	- Involves both immanence and transcendence
	- Includes original creation and new creation

- What is the theological significance of a doctrine of creation?
	- Universe is different from and dependent on God
	- Creation is purposeful and meaning (not random)
	- Creation is good as original created
	- Established God's sovereignty
	- Affirms future orientation (new creation)
	- Affirms community

- He does not create because of unmet needs
	- Acts 17.24-25
	- Ps 50
	- Job 41.11
- He creates
	- As a gift
	- Out of delight
	- This is what the Lord says:
		- "Let not the wise boast of their wisdom or the strong boast of their strength or the rich boast of their riches, but let the one who boasts boast about this: that they have the understanding to know me, that I am the LORD, who exercises kindness, justice and righteousness on earth, for in these I delight, " declares the Lord
	- Jer 9.23-29
	- Zeph 3.17

# Views of Creation and Evolution
- Old Earth Theories
- Young Earth Theories

## Old Earth: Theistic Evolution
- God used evolution to create the universe and life.  
- He may have  
	- Directed every step of evolution  
	- Intervened only when needed  
	- Merely kick-started the process  
- To create God used natural processes like a big bang, natural selection, a mutations over an extremely long period of time.

### Microevolution vs Macroevolution

### Day / Age Theory
- Creation was a very long process
- The days described in Genesis should be thought of as eras, each perhaps billions of years in length.  
- Also known as Old Earth Creation or Progressive Creation
- While some differences exist in these camps, they all agree that God created everything directly and supernaturally over vast ages.
- Problem with the idea of death of animals before human sin

### Gap Theory
- No telling how long the time between Gen 1.2 and Gen 1.3 is

### Framework Hypothesis
- The Days of Creation are addressing a theology of creation not a timetable.  
- The Genesis account is symbolic or literary, it is not historic account.

### Intelligent Design
- This is a barebones theory that the universe and life was designed 
- This notion does not focus on how creation happened or even who the creator was
- Many religious views fit into the camp
- Some atheists see the signs of ID even though they reject notion of God (Aliens did it. No, seriously).


## Young Earth
- God created in a literal 6 days (24 hour) time frame
- Most view the world to be about 6,000 years old
- Some extend it to as long as 15,000 years

### Problems: Cambrian Explosion
- During the first 30-million-year period of the pre-Cambrian period (approximately 570-500 million years ago), mollusks, starfish, arthropods, worms, and chordates (including vertebrates) evolved.  
- As Richard Dawkins notes: "It's as though they were just planted there, without any evolutionary history" (Dawkins 1996: 229).

# Providence
Notes:
- Eschatological understanding of creation leads naturally into doctrine of providence.  
- Providence= God’s governance of creation.  
- God directs creation toward his purposes.  
- General providence = natural laws.  
- Randomness?  
- Special providence = special revelation, miracles, etc.

Prof lecture:
- God created and is actually interested 
- Conversations about Providence very quickly turn to omniscience 
	- God being omniscient means he can never be disappointed in us

## Omniscience

Spectrum: Least Free Will > Most Free Will

### Ref / Calvinist
- God knows because he determined it
	- Fixed future / Predestination
- Sovereign in His power, no real human freedom
- **Hard Determinism**

### Compatibilism 
- Humans are free, not in a Libertarian sense 
- Controlling from the inside not the outside
- Humans are free to follow their desires, God exerts his sovereignty by planting desires in your heart
- Sovereign from the inside

### Middle Knowledge / Molinism
- "Every choice that every human has made has been free in a Libertarian sense"
- God is not affecting things on a choice by choice basis
	- He choice a version of the universe that would result in a world that most looks like His will
- William Lane Craig - Philosopher 

### Armenian / Wesley
- We are bound by sin, but our wills have been freed to respond
- Sovereign in His love, not his power
- Free will, free in the Libertarian sense: 
	- I have a legitimist choice between 2 choices of actions
- **Simple Foreknowledge**

### Open Theism
- "Armenians on steroids"
- "God knows all knowable facts"
	- But what I will have for lunch isn't knowable


# Theological Significance of Providence
- Life is not random but meaningful
- God directs creation towards his purpose
- Reject design. God didn't abandon the world
- Evil will not be victorious
- God is near to help us
- Our efforts are not in vain (1 Cor. 15:58)

# Sovereignty of God
- We really do not know what we mean by it, except God is in control
- Views of God's sovereignty differ between Calvinists and Arminians
- Both assert that God is sovereign but differ as to what that means and how God exercises that sovereignty 

- Divine Providence is “that solicitous, continued, and universally present inspection and oversight of God, according to which he exercises a general care over the whole world, but evinces a particular concern for all his intelligent creatures without any exception with the design of preserving and governing them in their own essence, qualities, actions and passions, in a manner that is at once worthy of Himself and suitable to them, to the praise of his name and the salvation of believers.” (James Arminius)

## Divine Determinism
- "He is accounted omnipotent, not because he is able to act, yet sits down in idleness, or continues by a general instinct the order of nature originally appointed by him; but because he regulates all things in such a manner that nothing happens but according to his counsel.” (John Calvin)"
- God causes everything that happens
- If God does not cause everything, God is not sovereign
- God's power is his most important attribute
- R. C. Sproul: If there is one maverick molecule in the universe then God is not God
- Free will is on radar
