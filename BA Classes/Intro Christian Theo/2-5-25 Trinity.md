# Holy Trinity

- Augustine is alleged to have said that anyone who denies the Trinity loses his salvation but that anyone who tries to understand it loses his mind


# Some Possible Trinity in Old Testament
- Gen 1.1 and 2.16 'Elohim with singular verb
- Deut. 6.4 'Elohenu (literally our Gods)
- Eccles. 12.1 Eth-Bor'eka (your Creators)

# Biblical Data for trinity
- Oneness of God - Deut 6.4ff; 1 Cor. 8:4-6
- Deity of Christ and the Spirit
- Distinction between the three persons
- Trinitarian formulas suggest equality 
- Functional subordination of the persons
	- Jesus saying things like "I only do what I see the Father doing"
	- Holy Spirit is like a sound system in the church

# Theology for the Trinity
- Church has to deal with 3 factors:
	- Monotheism (Deut. 6:4ff)
	- Divinity and Lordship of Christ (Rom. 10:9-10)
	- Experience of the Holy Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17-18)
- Account for Christ and the Holy Spirit....
- Problem: How to reconcile oneness and three-ness; equality and distinctions
- Heresies over-emphasize one or the other

# Inadequate Models 
- What is dynamic Monarchianism?
	- Jesus was an ordinary human being; at his baptism, the Spirit of Christ descended upon him and empowered him to do miracles 
	- An adoptionistic solution
- What is modalisitic Monarchianism?
	- Patripassionism-father suffered on the cross
	- "God is not all 3 parts of the trinity at once"
	- Doesn't deal adequately with Trinitarian texts or passages where all 3 persons appear
- Tritheism
	- Opposite error to modalism
		- Three separate gods, as in polytheism
- What is Arianism?
	- Arius, a deacon in Alexandria. Son was a creature
	- "There was a time when he (the son) was not"
	- Not human; a superior creation
	- Rejected at Nicea in 325
- Macedonianism or Pneumatomachianism
	- Macedonius, bishop of Constantinople.  
	- Orthodox view of the Son.  
	- Arian view of the Spirit.  
	- Rejected at Council of Constantinople in 381

# Trinity Doctrinal Development
- Ecumenical Councils affirmed divinity of Son and Spirit  
	- Nicaea (325) -Son is divine.  
	- Constantinople (381) -Spirit is divine.  
	- So elements of doctrine of Trinity were in place by 381 -but not worked out in detail.  
- Further details worked out by Cappadocian fathers.

# Augustine's Trinitarian Statements
- The Father is God  
- The Son is God  
- The Holy Spirit is God  
- The Father is not the Son 
- The Son is not the Holy Spirit  
- The Holy Spirit is not the Father  
- There is one God
