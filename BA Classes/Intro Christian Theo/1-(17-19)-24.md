# Intro to Theology
- Being both as concise as possible and as complete as possible, what must a person believe to be a Christian?
	- Believe in the Holy Trinity
	- Jesus is the son of God
	- Jesus died and rose again
		- Died for our sins because lived a perfect (sinless) life
		- Lived a Moral life (not a mistake-less life)
	- Apostles Creed 
	- We must admit we are sinners 

## What is Theology?
- The science or study of God
- But since God has claim to all of life everything is a potential subject for theology

--- Prof: Invites to deeply think about God

- Stated another way, **theology id a way of paying attention to God and to everything else in its God-relatedness**
- All humans endeavor to find meaning for our lives. For Christians, God is the lens by which all reality is viewed and upon which all meaning is based
	- "To be a Christian at all, is to be a theologian. There are no exceptions." - Howard Stone and James Duke, How to Think Theologically
- "A man that looks on glasse, on it may stay his eye; or if he pleaseth, through it passe, and then the heav'n espire." - George Herbert, The Elixir
- The question, is not whether we will theologize, but will we do it adequately 

## Why Study Theology?

# Thinking Theologically 

## How we get our theology
- Taught / caught
	- Sunday school, parents, chapel
- Fought
	- Struggle, crisis

## Two Kinds of Theologizing 
- Theology that has been taught and or a caught produces and **embedded theology**
- **Embedded theology** is the implicit theological assumptions by which we live and make our choices
	- Frequently, it is know but not able to be articulated
- **Deliberate theology** is the result of INTENTIONAL process of reflection
	- Engaging in deliberative theology is often a result of crisis

--- If theology is paying attention to God and the God-relatedness of things, I am tasking you with forming and cultivating a capacity for attention

### How is deliberate theology related to thinking theologically?
- When we speak of thinking theologically or theological reflection, we are talking about the process of moving from an embedded and implicit theology to a deliberate and intentional theology
- It is important to realize that it is not necessary for the outcome (what is believed) to change

### What is thinking theologically?
- "With the help of the Holy Spirit, it is the task of the entire People of God, especially pasters and theologians, to **hear**, **distinguish** and **interpret** the many voices or our age, and to **judge** them in the light of divide word, so that revealed truth can always be more deeply penetrated, better understood and set forth to greater advantage." - Gaudium et specs, 44

1. Pray
	- "The first and basic act of theological work is prayer... Without prayer there can beno theological work." - Barth
2. Slow Down
	- In order to hear, distinguish, interpret, and judge, we must purposefully slow the pace of asserting "thus saith the Lord"
3. Ask Questions
4. Avoid the Obstacles to Intentional Theological Thinking
	- Fear - a popular concern is that by asking too many and or too difficult questions, we can lose our faith
	- Pain - At times, some pain will reinforce the embedded theology, because of the gear associated with it. Once pain begins to overwhelm, embedded theology will be insufficient
5. Practice Intellectual Values
	- responsibility, perseverance, open-mindedness, empathy, integrity, courage, love of truth, humility, imaginativeness, curiosity, and fair-mindedness  
	- Humility 
	- Implied in the willingness to ask questions, is the attitude that I am willing to be challenged and/or corrected.
6. Engage in Critical Thinking

- Questioning and a Lack of Faith
	- Too often the willingness to ponder a question about God or the Christian faith has been understood to be a lack of faith
	- Luke 22:42
