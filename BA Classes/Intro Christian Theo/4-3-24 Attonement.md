# Theories of Atonement
- Words related to atonement:  
	- Hebrew kephar (to cover); cf. Yom Kippur  
	- Greek hilasmos (propitiation or expiation)  
	- English at + one + ment (reconciliation) 
- Atonement = the work of Christ for us.

- Christus Victor (“dynamic imagery”)  
	- Earliest Imagery
	- Dominant from 2nd-6th centuries.  
	- “Classical” or “dramatic” or “ransom” view.  
	- Cross was decisive defeat of powers of evil.  
	- See Mark 10:45; Heb. 2:14-15.

- Recapitulation (Irenaeus)  
	- See Rom. 5; 1 Cor. 15 (Adam/Christ).  
	- Christ retraces human history, gets it right, and becomes the source of a new humanity.

- Incarnational theory (patristic period)
	- “The Word was made man that we might be made divine” (Athanasius).  
	- Salvation as theosis (deification/divinization).  
	- See 2 Peter 1:4.  
	- We become like God as God’s image is restored in us by the Holy Spirit. 
	- Divine and human come together in Jesus.  
	- Still emphasized in Eastern Orthodoxy.

- Satisfaction theory (Anselm)  
	- Cur Deus Homo (Why Did God Become Man?)  
	- God as feudal overlord; people as vassals.  
	- Sin as offense against God’s honor.  
	- Satisfaction must be made to God (penance):  
- By a human (a human offense).  
- By God (infinite satisfaction required).  
	- Therefore it must be made by a God/man.  
	- Jesus is our substitute.  
	- Also called “commercial” theory.

- Moral influence theory (Abelard)  
	- “Exemplarist” theory  
	- Demonstration of God’s love.  
	- See Romans 5:8; 1 John 4:10-11.  
	- God’s love overcomes our fear and ignorance and prompts us to respond to him in love.  
	- Popular in Middle Ages until Reformation; also in classical liberalism.

- Penal-substitution theory (Calvin et al.)  
	- Further development of Satisfaction theory.  
	- Satisfaction paid to God’s wrath against sin.  
	- God as ruler, lawgiver, and judge.  
	- Sin as law breaking that deserves punishment.  
	- Christ bore our punishment in our place.  
	- See Rom. 4:22-25; 2 Cor. 5:21.  
	- Became dominant in Protestant Scholastic  
- Orthodox understanding (following Reformation).

- Governmental theory (moral governance)  
	- Hugo Grotius: emphasizes God’s law.  
	- God is ruler and lawgiver.  
	- He must uphold the moral order.  
	- The cross demonstrates the penalty for sin.  
	- Jesus did not suffer our punishment.  
	- The cross should deter people from committing future  sin. This allows God to forgive sin without encouraging further sin.

# Recent Criticisms
- Some feminists: atonement, especially penal substitution is “divine child abuse.”  
	- Shows God as abusive father punishing the innocent son.  
	- Encourages abuse, especially in families.  
	- Penal-substitution theory is especially vulnerable to this criticism.

- Anabaptists have critiqued the satisfaction and penal-substitution theories.  
	- No regeneration or reconciliation.  
	- Sacralizes violence.  
	- No solution for the social dimension of sin.  
	- No foundation for ethics.  
	- They often prefer Christus Victor.  
	- J. D. Weaver: Christus Victor was rejected because the church accommodated to the world.

- C. Norman Kraus: representative substitution model.  
	- God identified with us in Christ.  
	- Christ became our (final) scapegoat.  
	- His act freed us from sin and gave us a new identity as God’s children.
	- We benefit as we identify with Christ and follow him in discipleship.  \
	- Parent-child image.

# Extent of the Atonement
- Christ’s work was sufficient for the sins of the world. For whom was it intended?  
	- Limited or particular atonement: Christ died for the elect only (Calvinism).
	- General or universal atonement: Christ died for everyone, but only those who believe will benefit (Arminianism).

- Limited atonement focuses on passages that say Christ died for his people.
	- Lays down his life for the sheep (John 10:15).  
	- For his friends (John 15:13).  
	- For the church (Acts 20:28; Eph. 5:25).  
- Logically follows from the other four points of Calvinism. Why would Christ die for people God had decided not to save?

- “If God from eternity determined to save one portion of the human race and not another, it seems to be a contradiction to say that the plan of salvation had equal reference to both portions; that the Father sent his Son to die for those whom He had predetermined not to save, as truly as, and in the same sense that He gave Him up for those whom He had chosen to make the heirs of salvation.”  
- Charles Hodge

- Universal atonement focuses on passages that say Christ died for the everyone.  
	- Takes away the sins of the world (John 1:29).  
	- God so loved the world (John 3:16).  
	- He died for all (2 Cor. 5:14-15).  
	- He’s a ransom for all (1 Tim. 2:6).  
	- God doesn’t want any to perish (2 Pet. 3:9).  
	- Savior of all, especially believers (1 Tim. 4:10).  
	- Atonement for sins of world (1 John 2:1-2).

- Universal atonement also focuses on the command to proclaim the gospel to all.  
- Universal atonement is NOT universal salvation.  
	- Means Christ died for all.  
	- Does not mean all will be saved.  
	- Either not all are elect, or not all will respond.

- Atonement is both objective and subjective.
	- Objective = accomplished fact that has changed the reality of the human situation. Offered to everyone.  
	- Subjective = experienced only by those who respond to the offer.  
- This means that hell is our own doing.

- “Limited” verses can be explained in context.  
	- The church is the subject of discussion.  
	- Christ did die for believers; the verses don’t say for believers only.  
- “Some” is a subset of “all” (e.g., “Jesus died for me”).

- Universal atonement makes the best sense of the biblical data.  
- This is the point of TULIP that is rejected by “four-point” Calvinists.
- But four-point Calvinism is logically inconsistent.  
	- Why would God offer salvation to those he doesn’t intend to save?
	- Why should Christ die for them?

- What about those who haven’t heard – or adherents of other religions?  
	- Must all salvation be through Christ?  
	- Must all salvation be by means of explicit confession of Christ?

- Three basic positions on these issues:  
	- Exclusivism: Jesus is the only way; explicit confession of Christ is necessary for salvation.
	- Inclusivism: Jesus is the only way, but he may save people without explicit confession.  
	- Pluralism: There are many ways of salvation. 
- What are the strengths and weaknesses of these views?
