# Why Study Ecclesiology?
- “When we, the church, are confused about who we are and whose we are, we can become anything and anyone’s.  
- We can become a goose-stepping, Hitler saluting abomination, as we were in the middle of the last century in Germany. We can become a self-righteous, self-centered, and racist boot on the neck of our prostrate neighbors, as we were in South Africa until the end of apartheid.
- We can become a machete-wielding, genocidal horror, as we were in Rwanda, just recently. We can become a corpulent, self-important irrelevance, as we are in so much of America today. And we can become a sad, shrunken ghost, pining for past glory and influence, as we are in Canada, Britain, and most of Europe.

## Mirror to the Church
- The church’s primary purpose is not to make America more Christian, but to make American Christians less American and Rwandan Christians less Rwandan. We are no longer Rwandans or Americans, neither Hutu nor Tutsi. If we are in Christ, we have become part of a new creation. 
- I cannot forget that Hutu boy who fled to the bush with Tutsis. After two or three weeks they pointed out to him that he was Hutu and did not have to die. He left the marshes and was not attacked. But he had spent so much time with Tutsis that he was mixed up. He was confused. He no longer knew how to draw the “proper” line between the two ethnic groups.
- That boy is what Christian mission is about. 
- We have taken this stuff about tribe, ethnicity, and national identity too seriously. In so many places, it has become idolatry. What we need is a new sense of Christian identity that will cause a much-needed confusion of tribal loyalty. Unless this happens, all our singing and proclamations about Christ are empty words. Unless we are defined by a new identity, all our Easter celebration is nothing but a haunted liturgy, with death, genocide, and betrayal lurking in its shadow.”

# What's The Problem?
###### Diagnosing and Treating the Problems of the Church

###### Sx (Symptom): Univolved Church Members
- Dx (Diagnosis): Misunderstanding the Nature of the Faith
	- Not individualistic but communal
	- Disciples not converts
- Rx (Remedy): We must most towards a group-centered understandings of the faith (Chan)

--- Singaporean Theologian - Simon Chan: 
Chan suggests we should picture the church as it's essence: God's ultimate purpose is to form a people for himself, and the means to the end is salvation

Chan would say this to Utility: "Why do you want salvation if your not going to be part of the people of God"

You cannot live the Christian life without other people

|      | Need to go to church for obedience and bc the Christian Life is easier with others | Christian faith is a team sport, can't play without teammates |

###### Communal Nature of the Faith
- I Cor. 12.21 The eye cannot say to the hand, “I have no need of you,” nor again the head to the feet, “I have no need of you.”
- Matt. 5.23 “Therefore, if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother or sister has something against you, 24 leave your gift there in front of the altar. First go and be reconciled to them; then come and offer your gift.
- I Peter 2.9-10 But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, God’s own people, in order that you may proclaim the mighty acts of him who called you out of darkness into his marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you are God’s people; once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.

###### New Idea
- Christian Faith as Attachment
- We are born into the world looking for the eyes looking for us
