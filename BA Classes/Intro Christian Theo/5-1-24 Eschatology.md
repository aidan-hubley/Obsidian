# Eschatology and Salvation: 

## Glorification
- The goal of our salvation. 
- Our eschatological hope.  
- The completion of our salvation.  
- We’ll be perfectly conformed to Christ. 
- Includes resurrection.  
- We’ll be spared from God’s wrath.  
- Includes the renewal of creation. 
- Heaven is not our final hope.  
- Orthodox theosis


## Time
- Eschatology requires a linear view of time.  
	- Not cyclical as in Hinduism or Buddhism.  
	- History is progressing toward an end (God’s purposes).  
- Eschatology has reflected the varied fortunes of the  church.  
	- Eschatological fervor of early church faded as church became established and prosperous.  
	- Tends to recur in times of distress.


- Recent interest in eschatology arises in context of postmodernism.  
- No longer Enlightenment optimism.  
- Doctrine of progress called into question.  
- Realization that we ourselves can bring about the end of the world.  
- Loss of a sense of continuity; loss of sense of past, hope for future.  
- In this context, we have an important message.

## Preliminary Matters
- Preliminary Matters  
- We should distinguish central issues from peripheral issues.  
- Central: hope beyond the grave, resurrection, return of Christ, judgment, eternal life/death.  
- Peripheral: condition of people in the intermediate state, time of Christ’s return, timetable of end times events.  
- We should also remember the practical implications of these ideas: hope, comfort, encouragement to holiness and ministry.


## Death
- Most of us do not realize that death is a theological issue.  
- Theologically, death is a part of the doctrine of eschatology  
- One of the few elements of eschatology we do not have to argue the existence of!  
	- Everyone has to come to terms with it.  
	- But we do have to discuss its meaning.  
	- It calls our existence into question.

- Death was not part of God’s desire or intention for creation.  
	- Death isn’t natural to human life.  
	- Death entered the world with sin.  
	- Christ achieved victory over sin and death.  
	- We are still right to grieve at death.  
	- But we do not grieve as those who have no hope.

- Three aspects of personal death:  
	- Physical death: separation of spirit from body.  
	- Spiritual death: separation of person from God.  
	- Eternal death: eternal separation of person from 
		- God - if one is spiritually dead at physical death.  
- Death is also loss of community.

## Death and Afterlife
- OT doesn’t have full concept of afterlife.  
	- We tend to want to make it say more than it does.
- This does not mean that it says nothing  
- Sheol is place of death in OT.  
	- Some passages seem to say death is the end.  
	- Others suggest a shadowy existence afterward.  
	- Late OT begins to give hope of resurrection.

## States
--- Christians agree on **present** state: It ends in the death of the believer and unbeliever.  
--- Christians do not all agree on the **intermediate**  
state. (Sleeping, waiting, correction in an  
intermediate state OR directly and immediately  
translated to heavenly bliss)  
--- Christians generally agree on **final** state.

## Intermediate State
- What happens to people between death and Resurrection?  
- Soul sleep - soul survives in unconscious state.  
- Purgatory - cleansing from venial sins.  
- Instantaneous resurrection – receive resurrection body at death.  
- Conscious existence of the soul – experience the presence of the Lord.

## Final Judgement 
- People will be held accountable for what they know.  
- For believers, there will be no condemnation.  
- NT suggests that believers will receive rewards.

## Final State: Bad
- Passages in NT are highly figurative.  
- Gehenna (Gk., NT) = garbage dump outside Jerusalem, place of child sacrifice.  
- Main point: eternal separation from God.  
- Ultimate loss of community.  
- God grants people their desire to be independent of him.

- Most Christians understand hell to represent eternal  
punishment

--- Final- yes, eternal- ?
--- Some argue for annihilationism: the wicked cease to exist

- Some argue conditional immortality: idea that no one is immortal unless God grants them eternal life; without this they cease to exist.  
- Others: they pass out of existence, or they are destroyed by their sin, or God destroys them.  
- Held by John Stott, Clark Pinnock, Seventh Day Adventists, Jehovah’s Witnesses

	- Pretribulation
		--- Dispensational premillennialism 
	- Midtribulation
	- Posttribulation
		--- Historic premillennialism
