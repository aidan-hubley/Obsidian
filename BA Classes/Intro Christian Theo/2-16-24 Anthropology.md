--- The Doctrine of Humanity ---

# Humans 
- What does it mean to be human?
- What does it mean to be created in the image of God (image Dei)? How should we honor the fact that people are created in God's image?
- Prov. 22.2 
	- The rich and poor have this in common: 
		- The LORD made them both.  
- Ps. 139  
- Is 62

# Doctrine of Humanity
- Why study humanity?  
- Humanity as a creation of God 
- The image of God  
- The nature of human beings

# Why Study Humanity 
- We are the good creation of God.  
- We are marred through our fall into sin.  
- We are also the “central” object of God’s redemptive activity.
- We need to ask who humans are in relation to God.  
- Only then can we truly understand who we are.  
- We do have a God-given identity that gives our life meaning and purpose. 
- We can also understand more about God by reflecting on humanity.

# Humanity as a Creation of God
- We are contingent beings.  
- We are related to the rest of creation.  
	- We are stewards of creation.  
	- Unique place in creation (the image of God).  
	- God is the Father of all by creation.  
	- There is a human community.  
	- But this is not as intimate as the community established among God’s adopted children.
- We should accept finiteness as part of who we are.  
- Humanity is not the ultimate value; God is.  
- God, not we, decides what it is to be human.  
- We don’t have the right to decide the value of anything God has made.
- Humans have a paradoxical condition.  
	- We’re not necessary to the universe.  
	- Yet we have worth as reflections of God.  
	- And we have infinite value to God.  
- We bear the image of God.  
- We’re the objects of God’s love.  
- We have a place in God’s purposes.
- What are human beings for?  
	- “The chief end of man is to glorify God and enjoy him forever” (Westminster Shorter Catechism).  
	- We’re created to be a people for God’s glory.  
	- We’re created to have a relationship with God, with one another, with the rest of creation.

# Humanity and the imago Dei

## Biblical Evidence of imago Dei
- A. Possessing the “breath of life” or being a “living soul” (nephesh hayah) in Gen. 2:7 does not distinguish human beings from the animals.  
	1. Animals have the breath of life (Gen. 7:22) and are living beings (Gen. 1:20, 21, 24).  
	2. Only the image of God is not predicated of animals (Gen. 1:27).
- B. Both male and female are made in the image of God (parallelism in Gen. 1:27).  
- C. Being made in God’s image means that we belong to God (Mk. 12:13-17).
- D. Background is practice of ancient Near-Eastern kings setting up statues of themselves to symbolize their sovereignty where they can’t be present.  
	1. Thus we are in some sense a representation of God in and to his creation.  
	2. Maybe one reason God asks to have no images of himself made? He already has one!  
	3. We are not just the property of God but are responsible moral agents whom God has called to positions of trust.
- E. The image of God in salvation history  
	1. Human beings are created in God’s image (Gen. 1:26-27; 2:16-17).  
	2. The Fall damaged the image – Seth is in the “image of Adam” (Gen. 5:1-3).  
	3. Something remains of the image after the Fall; it’s used as the rationale for biblical commands (Gen. 9:6; James 3:9-10).  
	4. Christ is the full and complete image of God (2 Cor. 4:4; Col. 1:15).
	5. We will be conformed to that image to restore God’s image in us (Rom. 8:29).  
	6. We’re being progressively transformed into Christ’s image (2 Cor. 3:18).  
	7. We have a new nature renewed in the image of its creator (Col. 3:10).  
	8. The resurrection will compete our transformation (1 Cor. 15:49-53; 1 John 3:2).  
	9. This view of the image of God brings an ethical responsibility (1 John 3:3; Col. 3:1-11, esp. 9-10; Eph. 4:23-24)

# Views of the imago Dei
- Structural
- Relational
- Functional
- Dynamic

# The Image of God: Theories
- Structural or substantive  
	- Something humans are or possess.  
	- Characteristic(s) of human nature.  
	- Can’t be lost in the Fall, but can be damaged.  
	- Most dominant view.  
	- E.g., reason, spiritual sense, moral sense, social capacity, aesthetic capacity.  
	- Some distinguish image from likeness (image is natural, likeness is supernatural).
- Functional view  
	- Something that human beings do.  
	- Most common: dominion over creation (based on connection between image and dominion in Genesis 1:26-28).  
	- Humans as icons of the Lord.  
	- Can be lost in the Fall.
- Relational  
	- Something that characterizes human relationships with God or other human beings.  
	- Display the image when in relationship.  
	- Can be lost in the Fall.  
	- Barth: relationality is the image of the relational Trinity.
- Dynamic view (recapitulation)  
	1. Puts an eschatological emphasis in the concept of theimage of God.  
	2. Jesus Christ is the preeminent bearer of the image of God; we take on that image as we’re progressively conformed to the image of Christ by the Holy Spirit.  
	3. The fulfillment of the divine image is in the future  rather than in the past.  
	4. The image we bear in the eschaton will be greater than the image we bore by creation.
