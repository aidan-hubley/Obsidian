## The European American source of Tradition
Prior to the 1840’s the majority of American popular songs were European in nature. This was due to the cultural and linguistic dominance of the English and the prevalence of northern European inhabitants living on the North American continent at that time. English secular and sacred songs relocated to America and were sung as triumphant fanfares to a new life and sentimental reflections of the old life. Irish folksongs and German church music also played a huge role, and in smaller demographics, French and Italian folksongs impacted the music of America. Subsequent to Thomas Jefferson’s “Westward Expansion”, the American southwest would begin to see the musical influence of Spain due to interaction with their Mexican neighbors.

The primary musical characteristics of the European source of tradition are:  
- **The music is melodically emphasized**  
- The harmonies are “borrowed” from classical music and European folk songs and art songs  
- The songs are frequently written in ballad form  
- The melodies are symmetrically constructed  
- The phrases are constructed in even numbers of measures  
- The lyrics are frequently strophic  
- Melodies are sung “straight” with little to no alteration of timbre or articulation 

Early venues for music from this tradition were:  
- Pleasure gardens  
- Ballad Operas  
- Churches  
- Dances

The European source of tradition is still a major influence on the majority of predominantly “white” styles of popular music. Some current genres of popular music that adhere in part or in full, to the traditions of the European source are:
- Folk
- Country
- Bluegrass
- Acoustic/Country Rock
- New Wave
- Punk

## The African American Source of Tradition
The African American source of tradition is arguably the most widely influential of all the sources, particularly over the past several decades. White popular singers have gleaned stylistically from African American  
singers since the 1920’s, and popular dance music utilizes the rhythmic styles of funk, R & B and hip hop more than any other grooves common to popular music.  

The most common musical characteristics of the African American  
source of tradition are:  
- Use of syncretism; the selective blend of traditions from Africa and Europe  
- **Emphasis on rhythms**  
- Loose, flexible “riff-like” melodies  
- Asymmetrical melodic patterns  
- Simple song forms and melodies  
- Uninhibited use of dissonance, alteration of timbre and polyrhythms  
- Lyrics often reflecting the presence of and/or the overcoming of hardships (1800’s/early 1900’s)  
- Sung with more liberty to improvise than European style, leaving freedom to modify phrasing and timbre at will.  
 
Early venues for this music would have been:  
- Churches  
- Gatherings in homes  
- Minstrel shows  

Some subcategories of African American music would include:  
- Blues  
- Doo-Wop  
- Funk  
- Hip-Hop  
- Jazz  
- Jump blues  
- R&B  
- Rap  
- Soul

## The Latin American Source of Tradition
The rhythmic sensibilities, and song forms and styles of Latin music made their way into American popular song in the early 1800's, particularly Mexican music in the southwest. Latin dance music became an impactful influence in the 1880's with the American debut of the Cuban habanera and the Argentinian tango several years later.

Some current subcategories of Latin dance music are:
- The Bossa-Nova
- The Samba
- The Mambo
- The Cha-Cha
- Salsa Music (music of Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic)
- Tejano (a "Tex-Mex" style more recently popularized by the late Latin singer, Selena)

The defining musical characteristics of the Latin American source are:
- Emphasis on rhythms specific to dancing
- Simple song forms and harmonies
- Riff-like melodies
- Symmetrical phrasing with little use of dissonance
- Some use of instrumental songs
- Clever lyrics tending to be lighter in subject matter than other streams
- Frequent use of double entendre in the lyrics
- Sung "straight" with little to no use of dissonance or alteration of timbre and articulation
