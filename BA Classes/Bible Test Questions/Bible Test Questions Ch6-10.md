# 1. Discuss in detail at least five of what you consider to be the most significant of Cosby's "Suggestions for Interpreting Biblical Stories" (Book)
1. **Read the whole story**
	1. Avoid de-contextualizing. Interpret verses or paragrpahs on cotentex.
2. **Get into the story**
	1. Enter into the narrative world of biblical stories. Experience emotions evoked by the story.
3. **Be alert to reversals**
	1. Watch for reversals of expectations or fortune. They can be imoprtant to plot development.
4. **Think story, not lecture**
	1. Narratives do no function like logical lectures. Do not assume that when a character in a biblical story says something about God that the story endorses the comment.  
5. **Look at Bible maps**
	1. Using a Bible map to locate places mentioned in a story can provide greater insight inot an author's message (as we well see with the location of cities and regions in the story of Jonah).

# 2. Discuss in detail the concepts of resolution of conflicts, narrative coherence, dramatic irony, and exaggeration as used in Biblical story-telling. (Book)
1. **Resolution of conflicts**
	1. The coflicts might be with nature, as with the fierce storm at sea, or spirtiual, as with Jonah's relationship with God, or emotional/mental, as with Jonah's hatred of Assyrians and his disappointment and turmoil when God did not destroy Nineveh. The conflicts can also involve physical conflicts between humans.
2. **Narrative coherence**
	1.  Both authors avoid including extraneous material does not contribute to advancing their plot. There ia an observable cause-and-effect sequence of events, with each episode resulting from what preceds it. Both plots build towards a climax - a resolution of the conflicts.
3. **Dramatic irony**
	1. If we have knowledge that characters in the story do not, we can see implications of events that the characters cannot know. We also see incongruity between the words of charactes and events in the narrative - an incongruity that characters cannot grasp.
4. **Exaggeration**
	1. The size of gallows, 75 feet high, provides a good example. Such endings bring a feeling of balance to life, even though our personal experience does not always correspond to poetic justice. In real life, the wicked often win and righteous suffer unjustly.

# 3. Disucss in detail at least five of what you consider to be the most significant of Cosby's "Suggestions for Interpreting Proverbs" (Book)
1. **Slow Down**
	1. Proverbs reduce large amounts of observation into a minimum about of words, they often require reflection. View them as distinct units of thought. You cannot get in a hurry when deciphering their messages.
2. **Be culturally sensitive**
	1. Proverbs reflect the cultures that produced them. Ponder what a proverb presupposes about societal norms, including family life, business practices, and group governance.
3. **Laugh when approproiate**
	1. Appreciate the humor. Laughing at the word pictures created by such sayings is part of taking them seriously.
4. **Think before you apply**
	1. Be careful when you apply proverbs from Israelite cultures to your own. Do not assume that what is says is the final word on the topic. Use proverbs to get you thinking about a topic
5.  **Consider the big picture**
	1.  Adopt Wisdom's way of relecting on the long-term implecations of actions. Discipline yourself not to make decisions based simply on the short term, but on the long run. 

# 4. Discuss in detail at least five of what you consider to be the most significant of Cosby's "Suggestion for Interpreting Philosphical / Speculative Wisdom" (i.e. Job and Ecclesiastes) (Book)
1. **Read the whole story**
	1. When reading these texts, be careful not to interpret individual statements. Get a feel for the overall story of Job and for the overall arguement of Ecclesiastes.
2. **Appreciate the drama**
	1. Read Job like a modern play, being aware of the escalating rhetoric in the speeches. Comparing how the same person's speeches change throughout their story.
3. **Avoid historicizing tendencies**
	1. Do not seek to recontrust a precise historical setting for Job or Ecclesiastes. These works use Job and Ecclesiastes as literary figures in order to explore complex theological issues. Focus on understanding these issues.
4. **Do not tame the stories**
	1. Read these texts as attempts to change the norm, as protest documents. Avoid trying to tame them theologically. Such efforts dimish their value in the canon of Scripture.
5. **Let them stimulate your own reflections**
	1. Consider how their messages might challenge your own beliefs. Let these texts stimulate you to ponder what you think about life and death.

# 5. Discuss in detail the origin of the word "Jehovah." (Book (page 51))
1. The use of jehovah is usually traced to Petrus Galatinus in the year 1520 CE. Galatinus transliterated the Sacred Tetragrammaton into Latin, resulting in JHVH. He then combinded the four Latin letters with the vowels from Adonai, producing the hybrid form Jehovah. Becuase other Chrisitians were unaware of Galatinus's confusion on the matter, they adopted the name Jehovah for God. Once in the Chrisitian tradition, the name endured and may still be seen in various hymns and even in some older translations of the Bible. English speakers who say Jehovah are unaware that were actually no J sound in the Hebrew alphabet. 

# 6. Discuss in detail how days 1-3 of Genesis account "create spaces" and how days 4-6 "fill in those spaces." (Book)
1. Days 1-3
	1. The first three creation days describe separations of things to bring about order. On day one, God seperates the light from the darkness. On day two, God separates waters above from waters below. On day three, God separates dry land from water.
2. Day 4-6
	1. On day four, God creates the heavenly lights, filling in the separation from light and darkness. On day five, God fills the sea and the sky with creatures, filling in the separation from day two. On day six, God fills the dry land with animals and people, filling in the separation from day three.  

# 7. Discuss in detail the four main sources of Wellhausen's "Documentary Hypothesis." (Book)
1. **Yahwist**
	1. The oldest of the our sources, written in Judah prior to the division of the northern and southern kingdoms in the 10th century BCE. Texts from it are found in Gensis through Numbers in the sections like the creation and fall story in Genesis 2-4 and Tower of Babel in Genesis 10.
2. **Elohist**
	1. Written in northern Israel during the 8th century BCE by authors. Who used the name Elohim for God and depicted God as more remote than humans. Texts from it are found in Genesis through Numbers.
3.  **Dueteronomist**
	1.  Written in the 7th century BCE, largely to support the forms of Josiah, begins in 621 BCE. Consists mostly of the book of Deuteronomy, but also provides numerous passages from Joshua through 2 Kings. Strictly forbids worshiping other gods and focuses on the covenant between God and Israel. Consists of Laws and sermonic material.
4.   **Priestly**
	1.   Written in the 5th century BCE by priests who drew thogether legal material from various time periods and focused on priestly concerns, such as the Tabernacle in Exodus, the sacrifical laws in Leviticus, and the genealogies. They contain no angels, talking animals, or dreams. Only the descendants of Aaron are considered priests.

# 8. Discuss in detail some of the main points of "theology in Exodus." (Book)
1. Exodus shows us that God is a warrior since He fights for the Hebrews and liberates them from Pharaoh.
2. In Exodus 9:13-16 it says how the Lord told Moses to tell Pharaoh to free His people and if he doesn't then He will send Pharaoh all his plagues to his people and show Paraoh just how powerful He is.
3. Exodus shows us the Lord is mericful, gracious, and slow to anger.
4. The Lord planned to punish the people Moses brought out of Egypt since they worshipped a calf and not Him. However, Moses rationally talked to the Lord and He became calm. 
5. In Exodus 4:13, the Lord refuels both patience and anger with Moses, Moses keeps trying to refues the Lord's call but the Lord is patient with him. However, the Lord finally gets fed up and becomes angry with Moses because the Lord will not take no for an answer.
 
# 9. Discuss in detail the kinds of "tensions" that are found throughout the Bible. (Notes)
1. Tensions are, aspects of Chrisitan lifestyle that we are to WRESTLE with.
	1. Christian "passivism" <> Chrisitian "activism"
	2. God's sovereignty <> Human responsibility
	3. "You working out..." <> "God working in..."
	4. Unity <> Diversity
	5. Marriage <> Singleness
	6. The Kingdom now <> The Kingdom still to come
	7. "Re-created in Christ - all things new" <> "Wretech man that I am"
2. There are tensions in the Bible that God deliberately made.
3. These tesions will never be solved since the Church as a whole will never come to an unanimous position regarding them.
4. One Tension is between You working out your salvation and God working in You to do what pleases Him.
5. Another tension is between being married and staying single.
6. Another tension is between unified and together as one under the Lord and being not uniformed since we all recieve different spiritual gifts

# 10. Discuss in detail the Four Phases of the Divine "Search and Rescue" Operation. (Notes)
1. Phase 1:
	1. Evryone was the same, the same ethically, the same language, the same everything. There is no differences between individuals.
2. Phase 2:
	1. We are divided into nations. God pulled Abraham and told him, he will be a nation to reach all nations. The nation to reach, was the nation of Israel.
3. Phase 3:
	1. The Lord said, "Go and make disciples in all nations, and teach them to obey." The Church to reach nations.
4. Phase 4:
	1. Jesus is going to come back in thousands of years and take some people/disciples with him. Whoever doesn't go with him, the King needs to preach and disciple the nations.
