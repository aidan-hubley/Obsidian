# 1. Discuss in detail what Cosby says were "the developing Jewish beliefs about the laws of Moses."
1. As the Mosaic Laws became central to jewish life, the claims made about them became more exalted. Paradoxically the influence from greek philosophy, which spread around the Mediterranean world after Alexander the Great conquered the entire region, played an indirect role in this development.
2. Philosphers such as Plato understood the ultimare God to be a non-phyiscal, existing outside of time and having no direct connecction with the physical universe. They believed that a lesser deity, an intermediary called the Demiurge, created the universe. Although Jewsih teachers rejected this notion and asserted that God created the world, their writing reveal an increasingly elavated view of God - a movement away from the people as described in some chapters of Gensis.
3. Jewish documents preogressively mention more and more angliec intermediaries between God and the world. In the story of Daniel, God sends angels to reveal the meanigs of dreams and visions.
4. Increasingly, as Jews viewed God as timeless and more separated from creation, they began to see the laws of Moses more and more timeless edicts sharing in God's perfection.
5. Jewish thinkers increasingly separated the composition of the laws from human though and custom
6. Partly as a consequece of such beliefs regarding divinely dictated Scripture, Jewish teachers rarely pondered a biblical author's intended meaning in a passage. They considered such questions to be far too phyiscal and historical. Increasingly they believed that the laws transcends history.
7. A dramatic step in this development took place about 180 BCE, when a wisdom teacher named Jesus Ben Sira identified the divine wisdom personified in Proverbs 8:22-31 with the laws of Moses. Proverbs 8 personifies wisdom as God's companion and helper in the creation of the world
8. He connected wisdom with the laws of Moses. As a result, he paved a way for believing that the laws od Moses predate the creation of the world
9. By the first century CE, jewish scribes considered the law to be eternal will of God. One does not question it
10. Many Jews believed that God's faithful followers would in the afterlife keep the laws of Moses perfectly for all eternity

# 2. Discuss in detail apodictic laws and casuistic laws, with examples of each.
1. Apodicitc Laws - Do this. Do not do this. Meaning clearly proven or incontestable. The best known example of apodictic laws are the Ten Commandmenrs. "Remember the Sabbath day, and keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work. But the seventh is a Sabbath to the LORD your God; you shall not do any work..." Exodus 20:8-10 
2. Casuistic Laws - If/When something happens, then this consequences should follow. "If someone leaves a pit openm, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or donkey falls into it, the owener of the pit shall make restitution, giving money to its owner, but keeping the dead animal." Exodus 21:33-34

# 3. Discuss in detail at least five of the most significant of Cosby's "suggestions for interpreting the Historical Books."
1. 

# 4. Discuss in detail the historical events recorded in 1st and 2nd Maccabees.
1. 1 Maccabees recounts the history of the Maccabean revolution
2. The Maccabean rebellion is a story of a small group of zealors fro the Laws of Moses.
3. Judas lead the rebeliion and in 167 BCE he liberated Jerusalem and re-established worship of the Lord in the temple.
4. 2 Maccabess gives more background information leading up to the Maccabean Rebellion
5. It concludes with events in 160 BCE
6. 2 Maccabees describes the martyrdoms of Jews who remained loyal to the Laws os Moses desipte persecution

# 5. Discuss in detail at least five of the most significant of Cosby's "suggestions for interpreting the prophets."
1. 

# 6. Choose ONE of the major prophets (Isaiah, Jeremiah, or Ezekiel) and discuss in detail the main themes and contents of that prophet's writing.
1. Isaiah
	1. Prophet of God's Holiness
	2. Illustrates the lasting impact of a prophet and the ongoing significance of his words
	3. The early chapters of Isaiah presents God's complaints against Judah. These pracles call the people rebellious children of God
	4. Predicts that God will send Aayria to devaste Judah
	5. Insists that social justice maust accompany all religious practices
	6. Isaiah 1-35 consistes of his oracles
	7. Isaiah 36-39 gives a historical appendix to the oracles

# 7. Discuss in detail Cosby's direction for "analyzing Amos."

1. First - Outlining Amos - Identify each oracle in Amos, assign s short title to it Observe where they begin and end, for example, the numerical form of the oracles of judgement in Amos 1-2 provides clear guidance: "Thus says the Lord", "for three transgressions of", "and for four, I will not revoke the punishment", and "So I will send a fire..." (Amos 1:3-4). This repeating structure identifies the beginning and end of each oracle. Also notice the series of rhetorical questions in Amos 3:3-8. Look for rhetorical techniques as you outline the book
2. Opening oracles of God's displeasure
	1. On a map locate Syria, Philistia, Edom, Tyre, Ammon, Moad, Jidah. What strategy does Amos follow by condemning the countries in this sequence as he speaks to people in Israel? How might they respond to his words through 2:5
	2. Why would they respond differently to 2:6-16? Notice how the section condemning Israel is longer than any of the other pronouncements of judgement.
	3. For what sorts of things does Amos denounce Israel?
3. Oracles of judgement against Israel - Jeroboam II had a long and prosperous reign, and under his leadership the rich Israel enjoyed prosperity, peace, security, etc. But Amos predicts that Assyria will devastate the land. Ask: What complaints does Amos voice about the way wealthy Israelites treat the poor? It is uncertain whether or not the concluding section, Amos 9:11-15, was added at a later time. How does its massage differ from the previous material? What sarcasm does Amos use in some of his oracles?

# 8. Discuss in detail at least five of the ways that Genesis 1 - 2 have been interpreted through the centuries.
1. The Day-Age Theory: says that the 6 days of creation were not literal 24 hour periods of time, but rather stand for specific ages. Each day is eons long. Problematic is the fact that light and earth were created long before the sun, moon, and stars
2. The Gap Theory: says God created the heavens and the earth originally in Genesis 1:1. There was then a war between God and the angels who followed Lucifer in his rebellion, and the earth was laid to waste. The remainder of Genesis 1 is a Re-creation of earth and the universe
3. The Theistic Evolution Theory: says that God created the heavens, the earth, and all life using an evolutionary process, this process being generally guided by God but also subject to the effects of the Fall into sin
4. The Intelligent Design Theory: says while an evolution-like process has occurred, some form of intelligence has been involved in the ordering of the universe, the human body, reality, etc.
5. Strictly Literal Interpretation: says that God did indeed create the heavens and the earth and all that is in them in 6 literal 24 hour periods, in the order Genesis says. Those that believe this think that Creation took place a few thousand years ago

# 9. Discuss in detail the general categories of the 20 capital crimes listed in the Mosaic Law. What might Christians make of this list in the present day?
1. Sexual crimes - adultery, incest, bestiality, homosexual relations, etc
2. Sacrifical / god realted - sorcery, sacrificing to other gods, scrifice of a child, attempting to lead people to other gods, blaspheming the name of the Lord
3. Physical crimes - premeditated murder, striking one's parents, kidnapping, repreated neglicence in connection with the ownership of animals, etc.
4. Not listening to command - has all crimes in this category, but mainly profaining the sabbath and failure to abide by a judgement of the priest or Judge
5. Chrisitans might make of this list today by not commiting this crimes, it is our job to set an example, morally and legally. We must not commit these crimes to the best of our ability in the modern world. 

# 10. Discuss in detail - Including at least one example of - the differences between **prescriptive** Bible passages and **descriptive** Bible pasaages.
1. Presciptive passages are commands that the readers should do what the passage is saying.
2. Descriptive passages are passages describing something that happened
3. One example of how the New Testament describes the early Christian meeting in home. Some interpret these passages as prescriptive, meaning Christians should only meet in their homes and nowhere else like Church. Some interpret these passages as descriptive and it is only descirbing how the early Christians met in their homes.
