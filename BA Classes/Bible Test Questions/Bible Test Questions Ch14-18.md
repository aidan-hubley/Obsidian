# 1. Discuss in detail the specific audience of each of the four gospels.
1. Mathew
	1. Jewish Christian Audience
		1. Jews obeyed the laws of Moses, and were deeply concerned over Jesus's teaching about Moses.
		2. In this account Jesus does not challenge the laws of Jesus, He exalts their importance.
2. Mark
	1. Stories for a Gentile Audience (writing for lower class Gentiles, such as Roman soldiers)
		1. Focuses on Jesus's actions rather than His teachings.
3. Luke
	1. Addressing Educated Romans (upper-class Gentiles)
		1. Uses Literary Conventions of Educated Writers
4. John
	1. Ethereal Jesus for Gentiles
		1. John's Jesus is Eternal Logos
# 2. Discuss in detail at least five of Cosby’s suggestions for interpreting the Gospels. 
1. Read the whole Gospel
	1. As with any narrative, read the whole story so that you get a feel for the narrative structure and plot.
2. Prepared to be surprised
	1. Stories in the Gospels often turn social expectations upside down, so be alert to such reversals and their implications in the narrative
3. Laugh when it is funny 
	1. Some of the Gospel stories are humorous. Do not be so serious in your study that you fail to see the humor - often in ironic twists
4. Keep a map handy
	1. The location of events in the Gospels is often significant. Find on a map of first-century Palestine the places designated in the Gospel stories. By keeping track of Jesus' movements, you will better understand the narrative
5. Think story, not tape recording
	1. Abandon any illusions that the Gospel authors wrote tape-recorded transcripts of Jesus' words. You will miss their creative input if you dismiss their individual contributions
# 3. Discuss in detail Jesus’ use of aphorisms, hyperbole and overstatement in His teachings and  stories.
1. Aphorisms
	1. Brief statements of distilled wisdom, played an important role in society.
	2. Used for a variety of purposes
	3. Jesus uses a maxim to teach against greed and to demand devotion to God
2. Hyperbole / Overstatement
	1. Extreme language - used to grab the attention of his listeners.
	2. He made shocking assertions that required people to interact with his message.
		1. Note the outrageous nature of the following comment: "Whoever comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brother and sisters, yes, and even life itself, cannot be my disciple."
	3. Anyone who literally kept the command to give both cloak and robe would be naked. Jesus used jolting language to make his points about generosity and not being violent in retaliation. 
# 4. Discuss in detail at least five of Cosby’s “suggestions for parable interpretation and implementation.”  
1. Listen
	1. Read the story out loud and see what effect, if any, it has on you personally.
2. Interact
	1. Do not identify too quickly with the good guys in the story parable. Remain honest and open. You might identify more with the person whom Jesus criticizes
3. Research Details
	1. Use a Bible dictionary to discover the meaning of details in the parable that are not familiar to you (for example, Levites, priests, and Samaritans)
4. Study Context
	1. Analyze what clues the Gospel narrative provides for interpreting the parable. How does the Gospel already interpret the parable?
5. Consider Alternatives
	1. If you separate the parable from its literary context, how might your interpretation of its meaning differ?
# 5. Discuss in detail Cosby’s claim that “some parables are told to confuse, not to clarify.”
1. In Mark's narrative, Jesus's disciples come to him confused about a previous parable Jesus spoke. He essentially explains to them, "You've got it." This perplexing reply he adds a real zinger: he speaks in parables in order to prevent people from understanding - to stop them from repenting and being forgiven. He explains to his disciples that some parables given to those that "have not been given the secret of the kingdom of God."
2. Understanding the meaning of the parables is not the key to the kingdom - responding in faith is. Those who take Jesus seriously enough to come to him are rewarded with further information.
# 6. Discuss in detail at least five of the major themes of the Book of Acts.  
1. Spread of the Gospel from Jews to Gentiles
	1. The Christians movement spreads from a strictly Jewish environment in Jerusalem to the wider Greco-Roman world, and finally to Rome itself. Jesus announces this agenda in Acts 1:8. The rest of the book chronicles how it happened.
2. Unfair treatment of Christians
	1. Luke presents Christians as good people who are unfairly persecuted. In spite of God working miracles though them, in spite of their bringing help to those in need, they receive hard treatment. They are, according to Acts, not to blame for the disturbances that occur when Christian missionaries preach Jesus.
3. Goodness of Christians and their Leaders
	1.  They are peaceful, lawful, and pose no threat to Roman rule. Their leaders, the apostles, are united in their rule of the church; and under their guidance Christian's care for each other and mostly live in harmony. Acts presents Christians as God's people - those who have experienced salvation because they have repented of their sins and confessed that Jesus is God's Messiah. They have turned away from evil to pursue good.
4. Church fulfills prophecies to Israel
	1.  Luke - Acts presents the church as the continuation of the ancient Israelite religion. It is not a new cult but a fulfillment of God's ancient promises to the chosen people. Under the Holy Spirit's guidance, the church becomes a multi-ethnic group with diverse practices. Although Jewish Christians continue to keep the laws of Moses, Gentile Christians are not required to keep these same laws. Luke does not dwell on the intense troubles created by this diversity. He mentions some of the problems, but overall, he focuses on the virtues of Christians.
5. God is in control
	1.  The entire narrative in Acts gives a strong sense that God directs the spread of the new faith. Christian missionaries face many obstacles, but God brings about significant growth in spite of opposition. Early speeches in Acts proclaim that, although the crucifixion of Jesus was a horrible example of human cruelty, it was not a defeat but rather God's chosen way of bringing salvation to people - it happened according to God's plan. Acts simultaneously asserts both divine intent and human responsibility
# 7. Discuss in detail Cosby’s suggestions for interpreting Pauline letters.  
1. Find out the particulars of Pauls's situation when he writes
	1. Such details may be found throughout the letter, but pay special attention to the beginning and end to discover where and when he writes, who is with him, and his travel plans.
2. Uncover Paul's feelings toward his addressees
	1. What is his state of mind?
	2. What can you decipher about his past relationship with the people, including previous letters?
	3. What motivated Paul to write a particular letter at a particular time?
3. Determine what you can about Paul's readers
	1. Have they asked him questions?
	2. Do they represent particular segments of society? Jewish or Gentile?
	3. Are they progressing in their faith, or are they in spiritual and moral decay?
	4. Facing problems or decisions?
4. Analyze the letter's Mission Theology
	1. What major issues does Paul address in the letter body? How do these fit with what you can determine about the current situation of his intended audience?
	2. On what main points does he echort his readers?
5. Pay attention to persuasive speech patterns and quotations from the Septuagint
	1.  What rhetorical techniques does Paul use to strengthen his arguments?
	2.  How, and for what reasons, does he quote or allude to biblical passages?
# 8. Discuss in detail at least five of Cosby’s “characteristics of apocalypses.”  
1. Symbolism
	1. Cryptic images of frightening beasts
2. Symbolic numbers and code words
	1. Code words that refer to oppressive countries and individuals without actually stating their names. In Revelation the name Babylon is a code word the means Rome, the oppressive empire of the day.
	2. The number 666 in 13:18 stands for a person, whose identity was probably obvious to the original readers but remains a matter of debate today.
	3. 7 is significant number repeatedly used in Revelation to designate completeness, 7 churches, 7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 bowls
3. Repetition for effect
	1.  Revelation uses recapitulation by repeating the same basic message of divine judgment through a trilogy of plagues: 7 churches, 7 seals, 7 trumpets, 7 bowls of wrath. It does not present a chronological account of end-time event, but like a kaleidoscope of images relating to the future.
4. Determinism
	1.  Apocalypses present world events as determined by God. Kingdoms rised and fall by God's will according to God's purpose. Sometimes a prices number of years or even days will be stated regarding the time ordained for particular events. The authors show that, although things presently look bleak for God's people, God directs history toward a destructive climax in which the majority of people will not experience salvation.
5. Heavenly Books
	1.   A number of apocalyptic texts contain references to heavenly books which contain details about human destiny. Daniel 12:1-2, Revelation 20:12-15, 1 Enoch 47:3, etc.
# 9. Discuss in detail at least five of Cosby’s suggestions for interpreting an apocalypse.  
1. Read with imagination
	1. An apocalypse is not a literal report. Revelation is not an explanation of sequential end-time events, nor are its descriptions of beasts meant to be seen literally. It uses evocative language and should be read as imaginative literature
2. Avoid the crystal-ball approach
	1. To use an apocalypse as a tool to predict the future ironically trivializes the book - often reducing it to a text to manipulate to fit one's own eschatological agenda. Avoid making such predictions; it will save you embarrassment
3. Look at the whole picture
	1. Read through the entire book in one sitting. Be swept along by its images and notice the major issues that it emphasizes by repetition. Do not view Revelation as a detailed road map for predicting future events.
4. Identify the typical components of apocalypses
	1. Revelation contains most of these elements but is not pseudonymous and does not use the "history told as prophecy" technique. Its use of angelic revealers, fantastic beasts, and so forth, reveals that the author consciously wrote in the apocalypse genre
5. Be aware of the use of symbolic numbers
	1. The number 7 plays an important role in Revelation, symbolizing completeness or fullness. Be careful of thinking that when the text says "seven" that it literally means seven.
# 10. Discuss in detail the concept of gematria and its significance in Biblical prophecy.
1. A numerical riddle based on the values assigned to individual letters of the alphabet. By adding up the total value of the letters in a name, one arrives at the number of a person.
2. The number 666 is an example of gematria, the calculation of the total numerical value of the letters in a word. In Greek, letters also functioned as numbers. When authors used letters as numbers, they placed a line above them.
3. Who might be the 666? Likely was Caesar Nero.
