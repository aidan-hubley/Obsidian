It seperates what He has joined and that it what he hates. he wasnt sus to love what he loves and hate what he hates. People thought God commanded divorce through Moses, but the reality is He permitte it because of the hardness of their hearts

		1. "let no one seperate"
		2. "it is better to not marry as divoricing, except for sexual immorality, and remarrying is an adultery"
		3. This one how can accepty this should accept it - those who live by the word
	6. Hermeneutical principles that help apply this to your life
		1.Today divorce has seemed to become a part of culture. It's an easy way out as we fall in love with mistakes and abuse the power to divorce. A big reason is that we don't enter Christ in our relationships and when that happens it turns into an earthly relationship that has no foundation. Without foundation the marriage falls apart thus inviting divorce. God wants us to center Him os that when the storms come we on't even think about divorce, but look to Him.

		1. Peter fell from weak faith but Judas fell away becuase he betrayed Jesus
	4. Tensions
		1. People misread "if God permits" as implying that God may not want them to move past their level of maturity in Jesus and therfore would remain in immaturity - instead people needed to realize that it means the dependence on God to where if we do it is becuase God pleases it
		5. Simple vs. Complex commands
