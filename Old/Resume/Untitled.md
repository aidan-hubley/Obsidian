A bit about myself:
Hello! I am a very tech oriented college student who is looking for some real world experience. I am quite musical as well, tending to put music on in the background of studying, as well as playing percussion instruments and making beats. I am currently an RA at Messiah University, I served and assisted a floor of 43 residents this previous year 2021-2022. Christ is a huge piece of my life, He is my motivate and my savior.


What am I looking for?
I am looking for an internship that allows me to exercise my education, specifically in the Computer Science and/or the Cybersecurity field. I am currently looking for an internship that allows me to experience the Computer Science field over the 2022 summer. An internship is required to graduate at Messiah, this was my initial desire for an internship over a classic summer job. However, I am no longer in the need of internship credit through my University. I still desire the experience an internship could offer, especially at Katapult.

What are some of your biggest, most impossible life dreams? Dream job, personal goals, ambitions, etc.
I dream of utilizing my Cybersecurity and Computer Science degree to bring real change to the tech industry while spreading the Christian gospel. Specifically, I have always dreamed of living in the outskirts of LA and working in Silicon Valley, but I have recently been less passionate about this. A big personal ambition of mine is to stay healthy and to live an active lifestyle. After working at a Chevrolet dealership I became slightly interested in cars, I am very much interested in owning a Tesla Roadster. 



4. What motivates me to put forth my greatest effort is a combination of intrinsic factors like personal fulfillment, a desire for continuous improvement, and extrinsic factors such as contributing to the success of the team or organization, and achieving goals that align with my values and aspirations.

5. A typical day in the position of IT Security Analyst would likely involve monitoring and analyzing security alerts, investigating potential security incidents, implementing security measures or updates, collaborating with other IT professionals to address security concerns, and staying updated on the latest cybersecurity threats and technologies. Additionally, there may be meetings or communications with stakeholders to discuss security strategies or provide updates on security posture.

6. An example illustrating my ability to deal with an uncooperative person is when I encountered resistance from a team member during a project. Instead of escalating the situation, I initiated a private conversation to understand their concerns and perspectives. Through active listening and empathy, I addressed their apprehensions and collaboratively found solutions that satisfied both parties, ultimately leading to successful project completion.
