Throughout my life, a thirst for knowledge and a passion for leadership have driven me to excel in endeavors. My undergraduate studies in cybersecurity equipped me with a strong technical foundation, while my consistently high GPA reflects my dedication to academic achievement. However, I believe an MBA is the next crucial step in propelling my career towards a high-level management position within the dynamic tech industry. My Christian faith serves as the cornerstone of my identity, shaping my values and guiding my professional aspirations. It instills a deep sense of purpose, gratitude, and a commitment to excellence in all pursuits. This translates into a strong work ethic, a desire to lead with integrity, and a passion for fostering inclusive workplaces. I seek opportunities to embody the principles of love, compassion, and service exemplified by Christ, striving to create positive impacts within my professional sphere. Furthermore, I hold a firm belief in the enriching power of diversity. Throughout my experiences, I have actively sought to build relationships and engage with individuals from diverse backgrounds. I recognize the value each person brings to the table and believe that cultural intelligence, the ability to bridge cultural divides, is essential for effective collaboration and success in today's globalized world. My commitment extends to fostering inclusive environments where everyone feels valued, respected, and empowered to contribute their unique talents. My academic achievements and lifelong dedication to leadership have prepared me for the rigors of an MBA program. I am an eager learner, a natural problem-solver, and possess strong communication skills. I actively seek out leadership roles, both formally and informally, demonstrating a proactive approach that aligns perfectly with the collaborative nature of business education. My decision to pursue an MBA at Messiah University is driven by its exceptional reputation and its specific focus on interning and now co-managing Messiah's Security Operations Center. The program's emphasis on management aligns perfectly with my desire to develop expertise in team and company management. Furthermore, I am excited about the program's industry connections and its ability to equip me with the necessary skills to excel in management within the tech sector.
