Cybersecurity: the protection of digital information and assets

# Allen Snook:
Our scope has a lot of spokes. Student data, Employee data, PII, Ferpa. He is a team of one, to a ratio of 5600 people to secure. None profit org, so their budget is very small, $100,00. Lots of open source solutions. Very common for a University to use open source, tends to be custom programming. 

We don't consider PCI to be apart of our scope, we outsource it. Anywhere on campus that takes a card transaction. PCI includes payment processor. We are not a payment processor. Your transaction is encrypted at that point and is sent out. We rent M&T bank equipped, it is not up to Messiah to protect PCI, it is M&T.

~ Messiah Doesn't process credit cards
~ 4200 Students / 1600 Employees

Ferpa: Educational Record. Anything to do with a student, fin aid, test scores, what they are going to school for, phone numbers, addresses become part of the Ferpa criteria. It splits the data into directory and non directory. Student Search is a Ferpa issue. Directory is private info. Dorm number, email, house address, phone number, etc. This falls into the Directory category, however it is viewable through the Student Search.

Devices within Scope: How many devices on Messiah's network: every student decides to bring 4-7. They do not know how many personal devices are within their network. 27,000 devices viewable on the SIEM, Security Information Event Management.
