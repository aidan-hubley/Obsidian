# What is Close Reading
Close reading is a process of interpretation that is aimed at noticing details in a text, more often than not, minor details, as a way of thinking about what the text as a whole means.
1. Observe: read slowly and carefully and see what stands out to you
2. Describe: before you think through what this detail might mean, try to describe as simply and clearly as possible what it is
3. Justify: if this detail you've noticed was intentional, what might the author be trying to say through it, even if it was not intentional, how does it add

## Word choice
- Are there any interesting, confusing startling words or phrasing that jump out to you?
- Does the word choice fit the tone?
## Syntax
- How are the sentences constructed - short and choppy, long and languid? run-ons?
- Are the sentences of roughly equal length? 
## Imagery
- does it suit the tone of the passage
- are there any recurring imagery?
## Narrative / Structure
- who is speaking?
- is the narration or description force's on a single thing, or does it jump around?
- are there any significant shifts or breakages in the narrative?
- noticeable absences: is anything being left out?

# The Pale King - David Foster Wallace
Past the flannel plains and blacktop graphs and skylines of canted rust, and past the tobacco- brown river overhung with weeping trees and coins of sunlight through them on the water downriver, to the place beyond the windbreak, where untilled fields simmer shrilly in the a.m. heat: shatterhand, lamb’s-quarter, cutgrass, sawbrier, nutgrass, jimsonweed, wild mint, dandelion, foxtail, muscadine, spinecabbage, goldenrod, creeping charlie, butter- print, nightshade, ragweed, wild oat, vetch, butcher grass, invaginate volunteer beans, all heads gently nodding in a morning breeze like a mother’s soft hand on your cheek. An arrow of starlings fired from the windbreak’s thatch. The glitter of dew that stays where it is and steams all day. A sunflower, four more, one bowed, and horses in the distance standing rigid and still as toys. All nodding. Electric sounds of insects at their business. Ale-colored sunshine and pale sky and whorls of cirrus so high they cast no shadow. Insects all business all the time. Quartz and chert and schist and chondrite iron scabs in granite. Very old land. **Look around you**. The horizon trembling, shapeless. **We are all of us brothers.**  

Some crows come overhead then, three or four, **not a murder**, on the wing, silent with intent, corn- bound for the pasture’s wire beyond which one horse smells at the other’s behind, the lead horse’s tail obligingly lifted. **Your shoes’ brand incised in the dew**. An alfalfa breeze. Socks’ burrs. Dry scratching inside a culvert. Rusted wire and tilted posts more a symbol of restraint than a fence per se. **no hunting**. The shush of the interstate off past the windbreak. The pasture’s crows standing at angles, turning up patties to get at the worms underneath, the shapes of the worms incised in the overturned dung and baked by the sun all day until hardened, there to stay, tiny vacant lines in rows and inset curls that do not close because head never quite touches tail. Read these.

- Overwhelming
- Not as simply as it seems
- Wacky cadence to list of plants
- In an attempt to render nature in its beauty you end up with something that is kind of ugly
- Tedious amount of detail with the crows, "not a murder"??
	- Chekhov's gun? - If a gun is introduced in a story, it will go off

I would suggest that *Short Conversation (In Airport Departure Lounge)* is not a story. I believe a story has 5 requirements; a story must have plot, setting, character(s), a point of view, and some conflict/resolution. While this text does provide a setting, albeit in the title, I do not believe a conflict is reasonably present. However, a question is asked and answered so I could see a suggestion that a resolution is present. I would still suggest that a simple question and answer dialogue does not justifies a conflict. On another hand, two characters are obviously present as well as a point of view. A plot is not present, or at the very least so faded/undetailed that it is barely visible. This text is missing a plot and a conflict, and for these reasons I would suggest that 'Short Conversation (In Airport Departure Lounge)" is indeed not a story.
