# Topography
- Along the Tiber River, about 12 miles from the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea
	- Boundary between Etruria and Latium
	- Diverse mixing of people early on?
		- Helps later

## Tiber River:
- Fresh water
- Connects to the Tyrrhenian Sea without being a coastal city
	- Without the danger
- Tiber Island - easier to ford the fiver
- Sale
- High water table

## Hills of Rome:
- 7 main hills of Rome (there are more)
	- By the end of the Republic - Rome - known as the city of the seven hills
- Pros of the hills - out of water zone and watch point

## Campus Martius
 - The bend of the Tiber enclosed a large plain - Campus Martius
## Forum Boarium

Forum of Rome - The Heart of the City

Separate grew into a loose union sometime in the 8th century BCE - Palatine hill
 - Evidence uncovered 20th century (graves, huts) - confirm beliefs about Rome's foundations?
	 - Ancients believed Palatine was where founder Romulus settled
		 - Romans themselves preserved thatched hut thought to be that of Romulus

Italy in general in the middle of the 7th century BCE - more urban transformation
- Change form huts to villages, more organization overall
	- Reflected in Rome as well and the building of the Forum

Forum - public space that contained structures central to the community's political and religious activities
- Cult Activity - as early as 600 BCE - Temple of Vesta
	- Around the same time - earliest forms of the comitium and the original senate house

Regia - earliest version end of the 7th century BCE
- Rex sacrorum supervised many important public religious rites
- Rebuilt and changed several times early on
- 540 - 530 BCE - destroyed by fire 
- Rebuilt and remained unchanged

- Discovery of the "rex" cup found here


Rome's urban development also involved religious and domestic structures
- 7th c BCE - huts replaced
- End of 6th c BCE - spacious townhouses for Rome's wealthy
	- 4 found on the Palatine

Written works of the foundation of Rome
- Began as early as 5th c BCE and solidly determined by 3rd c BCE - Q. Fabius Pictor 
- Romans learned about history through the Greeks
	- Adopted Greek story of Aeneas as part of foundation
	- Developed their own practice then
- Predicted their foundation date due to annual magistrates list (began around 500 BCE) and then guessed the length of time for kingship
- 753 BCE - date given by the famous Roman historian Varro
- Had to reconcile this date with the end of the Trojan War (c. 1140 BCE)

Rome's early government - we believe to be monarchy - legendary 7 kings of Rome
- Names - do not indicate hereditary position
- Accurate dates? Not likely
- Attributed with bringing certain things to Rome
	- (i.e. Numen/Numa - divine will)
- Tarquins - Etruscans - more advanced - when we see advancements in the city as well
	- Cloaca Maxima - sewer system
	- Servius Tullius - Wall around the city
	- Tarquin Superbus - Capitoline Temple

Had imperium and auspicium


Patricians and Plebians
- Not sure how this class system evolves
- Patricians - aristocrats
	- Republican period - offices held only by Patricians
- Plebians - regular people - farmers, craftsmen
Patrician - patron with many clients (plebians)

**Populus Romans** involved thirty units called **curiae**
- These curiae were grouped into three sets of ten - tribes: Rammenses, Titienses, and Luceres
	- Other divisions amougst gens (extended family) and familia (immediate families)
		- Roman citizens thus had three names - many related to these strong family ties - praenomen, nomen, cognomen

• tribal and curial units formed the basis of the earliest political and  
military structure  
• Recruitment of infantry and cavalry  
• Thirty curiae – also served as voting units in the oldest popular  
assembly – comitia curiata (curiate assembly)  
• Almost entirely replaced by the tribal and centuriate  
assemblies,  
• Voted for offices  
• By 1st c. BCE –token office – ratify others’ choices, witness  
inauguration of priests, and approve adoptions/wills  
• Each of the 30 curiae represented by a single citizen –voting  
• Only voting on/considering Patrician issues  
• Struggle of the Orders (c. 500-287 BCE) - Plebians  
tried to expand rights and opportunities.  
• Mild success allowed some plebians to serve in  
army  
• Further divided into 193 centuries – class-based systems  
• Patricians had more centuries, therefore getting more  
votes in the Centuriate  
• Council of the Plebs –twenty geographical tribes with one  
vote/tribe  
• Annual 10 Tribunes of the plebs  
• Sometimes threatened to secede from the city

one year to produce a body of laws  
• Used to help pacify the Plebians  
• Final result – Laws of the 12 Tables  
• Two commissions – second group –  
painted as villainous – Appius Claudius  
and Verginia

• For a society where family/household = fundamental units of social life  
• agriculture and animal rearing = main economy
