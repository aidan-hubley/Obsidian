## National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance
#### April 3, 2023

**ChatGPT**:
The NCFTA (National Cyber-Forensics and Training Alliance) is a non-profit organization based in the United States that focuses on identifying, mitigating, and neutralizing cybercrime threats. The organization works with law enforcement agencies, academia, and the private sector to share information and provide training on the latest cybercrime trends and techniques. The NCFTA is meeting with your university to discuss potential partnerships or collaborations related to cybersecurity and cybercrime prevention. Your university may have programs or resources that the NCFTA could utilize to better understand and combat cybercrime, and the NCFTA may be interested in sharing their expertise and resources with your university.
