- Assumes the adversary does not know where to look
- Not Cryptography
	- Often combined
- Images
- Word Documents
- Detection
	- Often stego documents are encrypted

# Elliptic Curve Cryptography
- Asymmetry in Calculations 
	- RSA multiplication vs. Factoring
	- ECC multiplication vs Solving Systems of Equations
- ECC has better asymmetry in computation
- = better secrecy for smaller key
- Replacement for RSA

# Double Ratchet and Perfect Forward Secrecy
- WhatsApp
- FB Messenger
	- Assume that you will be compromise
	- Use KDF chain to generate new keys for each message
		- Earlier keys cannot be calculated from later ones
- Generate new public and private keys in a ping pong fashion
	- Later keys cannot be calculated from earlier ones
