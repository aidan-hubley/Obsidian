## NAT (Network Address Translation) / DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
Note: DHCP server assigns a **lease** to new IOT devices to connect to LAN
- Before NAT
- IP address assignments
- Leases
- Reservations 
	- Does someone get the same IP every time
	- Example: for a printer, so it gets the same IP
- Private IP, also call LAN

Note: NAT will **drop** any incoming unsolicited internet traffic, great for security

## Network Authentication - 802.1x
- 802.x usual stands for network protocols
- Wi-Fi at home vs. Wi-Fi at Messiah
	- Wi-Fi at home - anyone with password can log in
	- Wi-Fi at Messiah - must have full credentials (username + password) to log in
Note: Can allow specific ethernet connection

# Hubs, Switches, and VLANS
- Hubs 
	- 'everyone is one the same wire'
	- do not filter ports, simply send everything
- Switched 
	- Only broadcasts from the source port, doesn't broadcast to all ports
	- Beneficial for security and congestion avoidance
- VLAN
	- Allows for specific ports to be virtually segmented
		- No way of directly communicated with other (un-VLANed) ports
	- The only thing that connects LAN is routers

# Network Access Control
- Uses 802.1x and VLANS
- Because of the Bring your own devices phenomena
- Comply to connect
	- To ensure that new connections are up-to-date software
	- If not up-to-date, devices are pushed to a temporary **quarantine VLAN**, until up-to-date
- Need for an Agent
	- Needs some code to tell the Organization what the patches are required

# Proxy Server
- Passes along digital responses from one host to another
- Hides individual IP address
- Look like you are coming from somewhere else
- Block content
	- Likely Messiah's proxy server blocks content
- Anonymity
- Layer of protection
- Caching - First time a site / info is downloaded to the server (example: TikTok video), second time view doesn't need to redownload it
- Limitations 

# IP Addresses and Zones
![[Pasted image 20230201130658.png]]
- Area code and number
- Router vs. Switch
	- 
- Network Number and Host Address
- Mask
- CIDR

# Security Zones
- DMZ
	- Space in created to be a buffer zone in between the Internet and your LAN
	- Usually goes Internet > Weaker Firewall > DMZ > Stronger Firewall > LAN
- Extranet
	- VPN, helps to bypass the DMZ
- Intranet 
	- Normal LAN
- Wireless Zone
	- Bring your own devices go into this zone
- Honeynet

# Quality of Service
![[Pasted image 20230201132716.jpg]]
- Allows you to limit / throttle a specific amount of Bandwidth
	- Can limit it by amount reached
	- Can limit it by services
	- Can limit it by priorities 
- Priority
- Starvation
	- In a pure priority system, other services or people aren't getting bandwidth
- Greedy Users are expected, what system is fair?
- Gamesmanship
	- What is the policy for gaming on the network

# Honey Pots, Honey Nets, and Deception
- Honey Pot
	- Designed to be sticky and sweet
	- Distraction server, imitating another source, used for counter intelligence
	- Can tell you someone inside
	- In Civilian world, Honey Pots are not used for entrapment
	- In Warfare, Honey Pots are used for entrapment
- Honey Net
	- Collection of Honey Pots

# DNS Sinkholes
- DNS receives web address and returns IP
- Assumptions
	- You know that a domain is bad
	- You think you have or might have malware on your system (wannacry malware)
- Solution:
	- You know of a spreading virus, and create a false DNS entry in your record
	- No one using your DNS will encounter the virus
	- Block any outbound DNS traffic except for the server
- Pi-hole
	- DNS server for home use, looks for certain web domains
	- Great way to block ad domains, loads web pages faster
