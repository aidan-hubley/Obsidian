# Threat Types
Note: Are you an intentional target or did you happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time
- **Targeted**
	- Intentionally targeted for a very specific reason
- **Opportunistic**
	- People that have bad cyber defense, happen to be vulnerable 
	- 'Slowest animal in the heard'

## Stuxnet - Example of a Targeted Threat
Stuxnet isÂ **a powerful and malicious computer worm that first surfaced in 2010**. It is also reportedly the largest and costliest of this type of malware. It exploited the previously unknown Windows zero-day vulnerabilities to infect target systems and spread to other systems

## A word about safe ratings
Any safe can be broken into eventually. Safe ratings are measured in time it takes to break open. Opportunistic attacks assume x percent of people are vulnerable and you go after them. You want your safe rating to be higher, aka takes longer. 

# Other types
- Outsider
	- Someone trying to break in
- Insider
	- Someone with trusted access, generally know more about the system
	- Harder to protect against because you trust them
	- Often times, the attack is accidental and none malicious 

# Hackers Types
- **Script Kiddie**
	- Can't make their own code, they download exploits and run them
	- A lot of them out there
	- Can't do something unique one their own
- **Hacktivist**
	- Exploit ideologies for political purposes
- **Whitehat**
	- Hacking with legal and ethical permission, they work within parameters
- **Greyhat**
	- Do not hack with permission, but usually do it for the morally right reasons. Publishing exploits to the company, not for profit
- **Blackhat**
	- Do what they want, usually for profit, without legal permission

## How much is a hack worth?

# Advanced Persistent Threat (APT)
- Usually has the support of a nation state
- Has large resource
- Patient
- Has legal protections
	- Might be Blackhat hackers that cannot be legally persecuted
- AKA not officially a government organization but legally backed by a government

# Basic Attack Process
*TestOut List*:
1. **Reconnaissance** - choosing targets
2. **Breaching** - exploits targets, through technical means (hacking in) / social engineering
3. **Privileged Escalation** - You want root / admin access, go from normal user access to root
4. **Create Backdoor** - Want a way back into the system
	1. *Potential time to pause and wait*
	2. *Maybe install more backdoors*
5. **Staging** - Prep for Exploit
6. **Exploitation** - Cause damage to the system

# Defense Strategy
Note: Not a specific list of actions to have good defense
More of the list of principles
1. **Principle of Least Privilege** - If someone doesn't need a specific privilege, don't give it to them
2. **Layering** - Swiss cheese method - stacking many defenses to cover wholes
3. **Randomness** - Don't do the same thing over and over again, keep repetitiveness down
4. **Variety** - Don't put all your eggs in one basket, expensive
5. **Simplicity** - Keep it simple, no obvious flaws

# Malware
How it spreads:
1. Virus
2. Trojan Horse
3. Fileless Virus
4. Worm

What it does
1. Spyware
2. Ransomware
3. Crypto malware
4. Remote Access Trojan
5. Logic Bomb

- Malware is limited by the coder's imagination

- Called called **rootkit**
	- Can occur on both windows and Linux
	- special kind of malware, you want to be on the computer without their knowledge
	- Messing with operating system, usually installed below the operating system
		- Below the OS, makes you invisible
