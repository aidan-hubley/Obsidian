# IPv6 Facts
IPv4 is a 32-bit address. This means there are approximately 4.3 billion possible addresses available and many of those are reserved. The prevalence of internet connected devices have resulted in a massive number of devices that connect to the internet.

Since every device that connects to the internet is assigned an IP address, the addresses available under the current IPv4 addressing standard have been exhausted. To help remedy this situation, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) developed the IPv6 standard in the mid 1990's.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   IPv6 format
-   IPv6 components
-   IPv6 features

## IPv6 Format
An IPv6 address is formatted as follows:

-   An IPv6 address is a 128-bit address made up of eight 16-bit blocks.
-   Each block is separated by a colon.
-   Each block is comprised of 4 hexadecimal values between 0000 and FFFF. Each block represents 16 bits of data (FFFF = 1111 1111 1111 1111).
-   There is approximately 2 128 (340 undecillion) available IPv6 addresses

> The actual number of IPv6 addresses is 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456.

Because IPv6 addresses are so long, there are rules that can be used to simplify an address. These rules are:

-   Leading zeros can be omitted in each section. For example, the quartet 0284 could also be written as 284.
-   An address with consecutive zeros can be expressed more concisely by substituting a double colon for the group of zeros. For example:
    
    -   FEC0:0000:0000:0000:78CD:1283:F398:23AB
    -   FEC0::78CD:1283:F398:23AB (concise form)
    
    > Removing the zeros and simplifying the address is also known as address compression.
    
-   Removing these blocks of zeros can only be done once per address. For example, FEC2:0000:0000:0000:78CA:0000:0000:23AB can be abbreviated as:
    -   FEC2::78CA:0:0:23AB  
        or
    -   FEC2:0:0:0:78CA::23AB  
        but not
    -   FEC2::78CA::23AB

## IPv6 Components
An IPv6 address is divided into two equal parts. The left part is the prefix and the right side is the interface ID. The prefix would be comparable to the network ID in a IPv4 address; the interface ID is comparable to the host ID.

### Prefix: 
The first 64-bits make up the prefix.  

-   The prefix can be divided into various parts that identify things such as geographic region, the ISP, the network, and the subnet.
-   The first 48-bits of the address define the site prefix. The site prefix defines the location of the address and is assigned by the local ISP.
-   The next 16-bits make up the subnet ID. This defines the network that the device is connected to.
-   CIDR notation is used to indicate the prefix-length. Just like in an IPv4 address, this indicates the portion of the address that is being used for the prefix (network address).
    
    > To indicate the prefix length, add a slash (/) followed by the prefix length number. Full quartets with trailing 0s in the prefix address can be omitted (e.g., 2001:0DB8:4898:DAFC::/64).
    
-   Because addresses can be allocated based on physical location, the prefix generally identifies the location of the host. The prefix is often referred to as the global routing prefix.

### Interface ID:
  
The last 64-bits in the address is the interface ID. This is a unique identifier for each device, similar to a MAC address.  

-   Addresses are assigned to interfaces (network connections), not to the host. Technically, the interface ID is not a host address, but is often referred to as the host address.
-   Interface IDs must be unique within a subnet, but they can be the same if they are on different subnets.

To ensure that the interface ID is unique for every host on the network, IPv6 uses the Extended Unique Identifier 64 (EUI-64) format. EUI-64 format details include:

-   Since each device is hard-wired with a unique 48-bit hardware address called the MAC address, IPv6 can use it to generate a unique interface ID. The EUI-64 format uses the unique MAC address as follows:
    1.  The MAC address is converted into binary.
    2.  The 7 th bit from the left is flipped (from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). This bit is called the universal/local (U/L) bit.
-   The 16-bit hexadecimal value FFFE is inserted in the middle.
-   This gives a 64-bit interface ID.

  
For example, a host with a MAC address of 20-0C-FB-BC-A0-07 would start with the following EUI-64 interface ID:

> 200C:FB FF:FEBC:A007  
> (Notice the FF:FE in the center of the address.)

The interface ID can also be generated using a special algorithm that generates a completely randomized ID. This guarantees that each device will have a unique ID.

## IPv6 Features
IPv6 adds features that are not available in IPv4. The following table describes some of these features.

# IPv4 to IPv6 Migration
The worldwide transition from IPv4 to IPv6 has been and will continue to be a long process. IPv6 can be implemented now if the network systems support it. As the implementation of IPv6 proceeds, there will be times when compatibility with IPv4 will be necessary.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Dual stack IP configurations
-   IP tunneling

## Dual Stack IP Configurations
Because many networks have not switched over to IPv4, an IPv6 network must be able to communicate with a IPv4 network. One strategy is to implement a dual stack configuration.

A _dual stack configuration_ enables a host to communicate with both IPv4 and IPv6 hosts. In a dual stack configuration, the network adapter for each device on the network must support both IPv4 and IPv6. These devices can transmit and receive packets of both IP versions in parallel. When dual stack is implemented on hosts, intermediate routers and switches must also run both protocol stacks.

## IP Tunneling

Another strategy is to implement an appropriate tunneling method. Tunneling allows IPv6 hosts or sites to communicate over the existing IPv4 infrastructure. A device encapsulates IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets for transmission across an IPv4 network. The IPv6 packets are de-encapsulated by another device at the other end.

Tunneling solutions include the following:
### Manually configured tunnel
In this configuration, tunnel endpoints are configured as point-to-point connections between devices. Because of the time and effort required for configuration, use manually configured tunnels only when:

-   You have a small number of sites that need to connect through the IPv4 internet.
-   You want to configure secure site-to-site associations.

Manual tunneling:

-   Is configured between routers at different sites.
-   Requires dual stack routers as the tunnel endpoints, but is compatible with IPv6-only hosts.
-   Can be used to send data over the internet.
-   Uses a static association of an IPv6 address to the IPv4 address of the destination tunnel endpoint.

### 6-to-4 tunneling
With 6-to-4 tunneling, tunneling endpoints are configured automatically between devices. Use 6-to-4 tunneling to dynamically connect multiple sites through the IPv4 internet. Because of its dynamic configuration, 6-to-4 tunneling is easier to administer than manual tunneling.

6-to-4 tunneling:

-   Is configured between routers at different sites.
-   Requires dual stack routers as the tunnel endpoints, but can work with IPv6-only hosts.
-   Can be used to send data over the internet.
-   Uses a dynamic association of an IPv6 site prefix to the IPv4 address of the destination tunnel endpoint.
-   Automatically generates an IPv6 address for the site using the 2002::/16 prefix followed by the public IPv4 address of the tunnel endpoint router.

For example, a router with an IPv4 address of 207.142.131.202 would serve the site with the following prefix:

> 2002:CF8E:83CA::/48  
> CF8E:83CA is the hexadecimal equivalent of 207.142.131.202.

### 4-to-6 tunneling
4-to-6 tunneling works in a manner similar to 6-to-4 tunneling. However, instead of tunneling IPv6 traffic through an IPv4 network, 4-to-6 tunnels IPv4 traffic through an IPv6 network by encapsulating IPv4 packets within IPv6 packets.

### Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol (ISATAP)
The Intra-site Automatic Tunnel Addressing Protocol is a tunneling method that provides IPv6 communication over a private IPv4 network.

ISATAP tunneling:

-   Is configured between individual hosts and an ISATAP router.
-   Requires a special dual stack ISATAP router to perform tunneling and dual stack or IPv6-only clients. Dual stack routers and hosts perform tunneling when communicating on the IPv4 network.
-   Can be used only for intra-site communication. It cannot transmit packets across the internet.
-   Automatically generates link-local addresses that include the IPv4 address of each host, as follows:
    -   The prefix is the well-known link-local prefix: FE80::/16.
    -   The remaining prefix values are set to 0.
    -   The first two quartets of the interface ID are set to 0000:5EFE.
    -   The remaining two quartets use the IPv4 address written in either dotted decimal or hexadecimal notation.

For example, a host with the IPv4 address 192.168.12.155 would have the following IPv6 address when using ISATAP:

> FE80::5EFE:C0A8:0C9B  
> It can also be designated as FE80::5EFE:192.168.12.155.

### Teredo Tunneling
Teredo tunneling establishes a tunnel between individual hosts so they can communicate through a private or public IPv4 network.

Teredo tunneling:

-   Is configured between individual hosts. Each host handles the encapsulation and de-encapsulation process.
-   Uses dual stack hosts and performs IPv6 tunneling to send on the IPv4 network.
-   Can be used to send data over the internet.
-   _Miredo tunneling_ is the Teredo tunneling equivalent used on Linux systems.

## IPv6 Address Assignment Facts
### Address Types
Every device on the network must be assigned an IP address. With IPv6, each device can have multiple addresses. The following table describes the types of IPv6 addresses.
#### Unicast
_Unicast_ addresses are assigned to a single interface for the purpose of allowing one host to send and receive data. Packets sent to a unicast address are delivered to the interface identified by that address.

There are three types of unicast IPv6 addresses: link-local, unique, and global.
##### Link-local
_Link-local_ addresses (also known as _local link_ addresses) are valid only on the current subnet. These addresses are similar to an APIPA IPv4 address. Details include the following:

-   Link-local addresses have an FE80::/10 prefix. This includes any address beginning with FE8, FE9, FEA, or FEB.
-   All nodes must have at least one link-local address, although each interface can have multiple addresses.
-   Link-local addresses are used for automatic address configuration, for neighbor discovery, or for subnets that have no routers.

> Do not use link-local IPv6 addressing on routed networks. Routers never forward packets destined for link-local addresses to other subnets.

##### Unique local
_Unique local_ addresses are private addresses used for communication within a site or between a limited number of sites. In other words, unique local addressing is commonly used for network communications that do not cross a public network; they are the equivalent of private addressing in IPv4.  
  
Details include the following:

-   Because unique local addresses are not registered with IANA, they cannot be used on a public network without address translation.
-   Unique local addresses have an FC00::/7 prefix and include addresses beginning with FC or FD
-   Following the prefix, the next 40 bits are used for the Global ID. The Global ID is generated randomly, creating a high probability of uniqueness on the entire internet.
-   Following the Global ID, the remaining 16 bits in the prefix are used for subnet information.
-   Unique local addresses are likely to be globally unique, but they are not globally routable. Unique local addresses might be routed between sites by a local ISP.

The process for designing a network addressing scheme when using unique local addresses is similar to that used for global unicast addresses. The key difference is how the prefix is defined. Because the address range is not registered:

-   A global routing prefix does not have to be requested from an ISP.
-   Each organization defines its own prefix.

##### Global unicast
Global unicast addresses are assigned to individual interfaces that are globally unique. Key facts about global unicast address include:

-   All IPv6 addresses that aren't specifically reserved for other purposes are defined as global unicast addresses.
-   The global routing prefix assigned to an organization by an ISP is typically 48 bits long (/48), but it could be as short as /32 or as long as /56, depending on the ISP.
-   All subnet IDs within the same organization must begin with the same global routing prefix, but they must also be uniquely identified using a different value in the subnet field.
-   Using this addressing scheme allows organizations to define a large number (2 16) of IPv6 subnets.

When designing an IPv6 network, separate IPv6 subnets can be defined by the following:

-   Network segments separated by routers
-   VLANs
-   Point-to-point WAN links

#### Multicast
_Multicast_ addresses represent a dynamic group of hosts. Packets sent to a multicast address are sent to all interfaces identified by that address. If different multicast addresses are used for different functions, only the devices that need to participate in a particular function will respond to the multicast; devices that do not need to participate in the function will ignore the multicast.  
  
Details include the following:

-   All multicast addresses have an FF00::/8 prefix.
-   Multicast addresses that are restricted to the local link have only an FF02::/16 prefix. Packets starting with FF02 are not forwarded by routers.
-   Multicast addresses with an FF01::/16 prefix are restricted to a single node.

The following are well-known multicast addresses:

-   FF02::1 is for all nodes on the local link. This is the equivalent of the IPv4 subnet broadcast address. FF01::1 is for all interfaces on a node.
-   FF02::2 is for all routers on the local link. FF01::2 is for all routers on node-local.
-   FF02::1:2 is for all DHCP servers or DHCP relay agents on the local link. DHCP relay agents forward these packets to other subnets.

> There are no broadcast addresses in IPv6. IPv6 multicast addresses are used instead of broadcast addresses.


#### Anycast
  
The _anycast_ address is a unicast address that is assigned to more than one interface, typically belonging to different hosts. An anycast packet is routed to the nearest interface having that address (based on routing protocol decisions).  
  
Details include the following:

-   An anycast address is the same as a unicast address. Assigning the same unicast address to more than one interface makes it an anycast address.
-   An anycast address can be a link-local, unique local, or global unicast address.
-   When assigning an anycast address to an interface, it must be explicitly identified as an anycast address to distinguish it from a unicast address.
-   Anycast addresses can be used to locate the nearest server of a specific type (for example, the nearest DNS or network time server).

#### Loopback
The local loopback address for the local host is 0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1 (also identified as ::1 or ::1/128). The local loopback address is not assigned to an interface. It can verify that the TCP/IP protocol stack is properly installed on the host.
