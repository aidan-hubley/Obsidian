Network communication issues are a common problem that network technicians spend time troubleshooting and correcting.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Improper IP configuration
-   Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) issues
-   Troubleshooting tools

## Improper IP Configuration
One of the most common reasons for communication issues on an IP-based network is improperly configured IP settings. If the IP configuration is not correct, devices can't communicate.

The following table describes some of the more common configuration issues.
### Incorrect subnet mask
The subnet mask defines the octets that belong to the network ID and the octets that are unique to the host. All devices on a subnet must be configured with the same subnet mask and have matching network IDs.

-   If using classful addressing, the subnet mask can be determined by looking at the first octet.
-   If using classless addressing, verify that each host address falls within the subnet address range.

If the subnet masks and network IDs do not match, the device is considered to be on a different logical network and will not be able to communicate with other network devices on the subnet.

### Default Gateway Misconfiguration
The default gateway is responsible for forwarding data from an internal network to devices outside of the network.

-   When sending a packet to another device on the same network, IP uses ARP to determine the appropriate MAC address and sends the packet directly to the destination.
-   If IP determines that the receiving device is on a different network, that packet is immediately forwarded to the default gateway router address which then handles routing the packet to the receiver.
-   If the default gateway is not configured properly, devices will be able to communicate on the local network, but will not be able to communicate outside of the network.
-   The default gateway router must reside on the same logical network as the host.

### DNS Misconfiguration
DNS is responsible for translating an IP address into a host name.

-   If a device can ping a remote host using the IP address, but not it's DNS host name, there is an issue with DNS.
-   You should verify the DNS server address is correct in the IP settings.
-   If that setting is correct, the problem most likely is the DNS server and should be escalated.

### Duplicate MAC Addresses
The MAC address is a unique 12-digit hexadecimal number (48 bits). There should be no duplicate MAC addresses on a network. However, it is possible for two hosts to have the same MAC address, due to:

-   Spoofing.
-   A mistake during manufacturing.
-   Users choose a self-assigned address instead of the vendor-assigned hardware address. This is more common when using mainframe systems that communicate via MAC addresses rather than protocol addresses (IP addresses).

An Ethernet switch keeps a table that identifies the ports that MAC addresses are attached to.

-   The Ethernet switch uses the source address of frames it receives during the normal operation of the network to make the table.
-   When the switch receives a frame, the source MAC is read, compared with the current table, and then added alongside the switch port it was received on.
-   If there are two hosts with the same MAC address, the switch updates it's MAC table every time it receives a frame from either host. Reaching either host will be inconsistent and may cause other problems.

## DHCP Issues
When a host connects to the network, it obtains its IP configuration from the DHCP server if it is configured to do so. The DHCP server issues IP addresses, subnet masks, the default gateway address, and DNS server addresses.

If the host is unable to obtain this information or is given incorrect information, it will not be able to communicate on the network. The following table describes some common DHCP issues:
### Incorrectly configured DHCP server
The DHCP server can send out various IP configuration values, such as the IP address, subnet mask, and DNS server. If you determine that network hosts are configured with incorrect IP values:

-   You should verify that the workstations are contacting the correct DHCP server.
-   If the correct server is being used, go to the DHCP server to determine the configuration information it is sending.

### Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
If a host cannot contact the DHCP server, it is assigned an IP address using Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA).  
  
When APIPA is used:

-   The device will have an IP address in the range of 169.254.0.1 to 169.254.255.254, with a mask of 255.255.0.0.
-   No default gateway or DNS server values are set.
-   Communication is restricted to hosts within the same subnet.
-   Hosts can communicate with other hosts using APIPA.
-   If some hosts are still using an address assigned by the DHCP server (even if the DHCP server is down), those hosts will not be able to communicate with the APIPA hosts.
-   Name resolution will not be performed.

## Rogue DHCP server
A rogue DHCP server is an unauthorized DHCP server on the network. Symptoms of a rogue DHCP server include:

-   Conflicting IP addresses on the network.
-   Duplicate IP addresses on the network.
-   Incorrect IP configuration information on some hosts.

> When a rogue DHCP server exists on the network, some hosts may receive configuration information from the correct DHCP server and others from the rogue DHCP server.


### Exhausted DHCP scope
A rogue DHCP server is an unauthorized DHCP server on the network. Symptoms of a rogue DHCP server include:

-   Conflicting IP addresses on the network.
-   Duplicate IP addresses on the network.
-   Incorrect IP configuration information on some hosts.

> When a rogue DHCP server exists on the network, some hosts may receive configuration information from the correct DHCP server and others from the rogue DHCP server.


## Troubleshooting Tools
The following command line tools can be used to troubleshoot IP configuration problems:

### Ping 
The ping command sends an ICMP echo request/reply packet to a remote host. A response from the remote host indicates that both hosts are correctly configured and a connection exists between them. You can ping a host by IP address or use the DNS name. When the DNS name is used, the computer must look up the corresponding IP address before performing the ping test.

Examples:  
**ping 92.184.216.34  
ping www.example.com

### Tracert
The tracert (trace route) command tests connectivity between two devices and displays the path between them. Responses from each hop on the route are measured three times to provide an accurate representation of how long the packet takes to reach and be returned by that host. The tracert command can be used to find the route using an IP address or a fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

Examples:  
**tracert 92.184.216.34  
tracert www.example.com**

When troubleshooting IP configuration problems, using tracert can give you a better idea as to which device may be misconfigured.


### ipconfig
The ipconfig command displays all current TCP/IP network configuration values and refreshes Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) settings. The ipconfig command displays the following for each adapter:

-   DNS suffix
-   Link-local IPv6 address
-   IPv4 address
-   Subnet mask
-   Default gateway

The following table describes some common switches you can use to identify and troubleshoot IP communication issues:
