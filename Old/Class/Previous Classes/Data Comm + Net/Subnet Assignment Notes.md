- Developing the WAN for company XYZ. They have been given a Class B internet license - 160.60.0.0.
- The company has chose to subnet in the following manner:
	- In Los Angeles, they have 5 buildings and desire each building to have 4 LANs.
	- In Chicago, they have 4 building and desire and desire each building to have 3 LANs.
	- In Memphis, they have 2 buildings and desire a 3 LANs in each building.
	- In Dallas, they have 10 buildings and desire 7 LANs in each.
	- In New York they have 5 buildings and desire 10 LANs in each.
	- In Orlando, they have 10 buildings and desire 4 LANs in each.
- They also want a spare LAN address spaces, which we call subnets, per building in each city.  In addition to the subnets for each building in each city, you need to account for a separate subnet for each serial link between cities (Router – to –Router links).
- Routers are linking in the following manner:
	- The router in Los Angeles is linked to Chicago only.
	- The Chicago Router is linked to Memphis and New York.
	- The Memphis Router, in addition to being linked to Chicago, is also linked to Dallas and New York.
	- Dallas in only linked to Memphis.
	- New York, in addition to being linked to Chicago and Memphis is linked to Orlando.
	- Orlando is only linked to New York.

- LA has 25 subnets
	- What is the minimum number of bits is needed to borrow?
- Example:
	- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ 
	- first half is the net
	- second half is the host
		- subnets can go anywhere in the second half
		- first half (net) . _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
			- Here the subnet is the first three digits
				- 001 - 010 - 011 - 100- 101 - 110 - 111
		- When using the 001, the subnet = 32
			- binary of 001|00000 = 32
		- Every next subnet is just an additional increment of the first
			- 010 = 62
			- 011 = 96
			- 100 = 128
			- 101 = 160
			- 110 = 192, etc
- Subnetting a Subnet
	- We have:
	- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _
	- 160.60.subnet/host
	- Lets use subnet .001_ _ _ _ _ = 32
	- This is not enough for the whole network, we need to subnet a this subnet
	- _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ |001| _ _ _ _ _ . _ _ _ | _ _ _ _ _
	- Here we assigned a new subnet inside of the 001 subnet, = 001 in the fourth octect
	- New subnet subnet for LA = 160.60.32.0/27
