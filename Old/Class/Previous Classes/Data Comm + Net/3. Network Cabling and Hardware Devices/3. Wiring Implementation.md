# Cable Construction Facts
Twisted pair cabling is one of the primary ways that computers connect to networks.

## RJ45 Wiring Conventions

There are two Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) standards for creating straight-through cables. It doesn't matter which standard you use, T568A or T568B. But once you choose a standard, you should use the same one for all cables to avoid confusion when troubleshooting.
|Standard|Pinout Order|
|-|-|
|T568A<br>![Standards for straight-through cables T568A](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_twisted_pair_cons_np6/t568a.png)  |Pin 1: GW = White with green stripe  <br>Pin 2: G = Green  <br>Pin 3: OW = White with orange stripe<br>Pin 4: B = Blue<br>Pin 5: BW = White with blue stripe<br>Pin 6: O = Orange<br>Pin 7: BrW = White with brown stripe<br>  Pin 8: Br = Brown

## Straight-Through and Crossover Cables

Using the TIA wiring standards, twisted pair cables are constructed as either straight-though or crossover cables.
|Cable|Description|
|-|-|
|Straight-Through<br>![Twisted pair straight-though cable](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_twisted_pair_cons_np6/st.png)|  Most twisted pair cables are manufactured as straight-through cables  <br> <br>Connect computers to a hub or switch with a straight-through cable.  <br> <br>The pinout order on a computer's network interface card (NIC) is different than the pinout order on the hub or switch port.  <br><br>Transmit pins of the NIC map to the receive pins on hub or switch and vice versa.
|Crossover<br>![Twisted pair Crossover cable](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_twisted_pair_cons_np6/co.png)  |If a network device such as a hub or switch does not have an uplink port, use a crossover cable when connecting it to another network device.<br><br>You can also connect one computer directly to another using a crossover cable. <br><br>A crossover cable maps the transmit pins on one end of the cable with the receive pins on the other end.  <br><br>You can easily create a crossover cable as follows:<br><br>-   Use the T568A standard to attach an RJ45 connector to one end.<br>-   Use the T568B standard to attach an RJ45 to the other end.

## Constructing Cables with RJ45 Connectors

When creating a twisted pair cable using RJ45 connectors:

-   Use a crimping tool designed for RJ45 connectors.  
    ![Crimping tool designed for RJ45 connectors](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_twisted_pair_cons_np6/crimp.png)
-   Determine whether the cable wires have solid cores or stranded cores.
    -   Be sure to use the correct RJ45 connector type, solid or stranded.
    -   Use solid core cables for longer runs inside walls or the ceiling.
    -   Use stranded core wires for patch cables and for drop cables where frequent movement occurs and flexibility is needed.
-   To reduce crosstalk, keep the pairs twisted as much as possible right up to the connector. Be aware that Cat 6- and Cat 6a-compliant cables may not perform at 10 Gbps if the pairs are not twisted right up to the connector.

## Gigabit Ethernet Cabling

For 10-Mbps Ethernet over twisted pair (10BASE-T) and 100-Mbps Ethernet over twisted pair (100BASE-TX), you use only two of the twisted pairs of wires in a Cat 3, Cat 5, or Cat 5e cable. The following pins are used for a computer NIC:

-   Pin 1: Transmit +  
    Pin 2: Transmit -  
    Pin 3: Receive +  
    Pin 6: Receive -
-   Pins 4, 5, 7, and 8 are unused.

1000BASE-T or Gigabit Ethernet uses all four pairs of wires in Cat 5e or above cables.

-   There are positive (+) and negative (-) pins for each pair of wires.
-   Signals go in both directions over each pair of wires, so there are no dedicated transmit and receive pins.
-   The T568A and T568B wiring standards are still used.

If Cat 7 cabling is used for 10 Gigabit Ethernet, the cables are terminated with GG45 or TERA connectors.

-   GG45 connectors require a special set of tools that are different from the RJ45 crimping tool.
-   TERA connectors can be installed without any special tools.

## Power over Ethernet Cabling

PoE technologies allow network cables to carry electrical power. This is helpful for remote devices where no external power is available. Another notable use is digital telephone systems where handsets are powered through the Ethernet cable, eliminating the need for a separate power adapter.

-   Power can be supplied through one of the unused pairs of wires in 10- and 100-Megabit Ethernet.
-   Power can also be supplied using one of the data wires.
-   Many network switches have the option to supply PoE.
-   PoE injection devices can be added to the middle of the cable span.

# Wiring Distribution Facts
Network administrators are often responsible for data and telephone wiring.

## Demarcation Points

When you contract with a local exchange carrier (LEC) for data, internet, or telephone services, they install a physical cable and a termination jack on your premises. The demarc (short for demarcation point) is the line that marks the boundary between the telco equipment or cable and your private network or telephone system. The demarc is also called the minimum point of entry (MPOE) or the end user point of termination (EU-POT). In businesses, the demarc is typically located on the bottom floor of a building, just inside a door, and identified by an orange plastic cover on the wiring component. In residential buildings, the demarc is often a small box on the outside of the house.

-   The demarc may be:
    -   A box on the wall with a simple RJ45 connection
    -   A 50-pin RJ21 connector
    -   A fiber optic connection
    -   A port on a network interface device (NID

If needed, a demarc extension can be used to move the demarc to another location in a building. For example, if your organization uses only one floor of a building, you will want the demarc where it is not exposed to other organizations. You are responsible for installing the demarc extension, but the LEC might do it for an additional charge. Normally, the LEC is responsible for all equipment on one side of the demarc, and the customer is responsible for all equipment on the other side of the demarc.

While a NID can be a passive demarc that organizes the cable and connections, a more intelligent NID, known as smartjack, may be provided by the LEC. Smartjacks:

-   Are maintained by the LEC.
-   Are typically used for more complex services, such as a T1 line.
-   Can provide signal conversions, buffer signals, and regenerate signals.
-   May provide diagnostic capabilities for the LEC.
    -   The loopback capability can be used to test signals by transmitting them back to the LEC.
    -   Alarm indicators can report trouble to the LEC.
    -   Indicator lights can show the configuration and status of the Smartjack.

## Main Distribution Frames (MDFs), Intermediate Distribution Frames (IDFs), and Building Industry Cross-Connect (BIX)

Strictly speaking, a main distribution frame (MDF) is a frame or rack that is used to interconnect and manage telecommunication wiring in a building. It functions like an old-time telephone switchboard, where operators used connecting wires to route telephone calls. Today's MDF describes the room that houses the traditional MDF along with networking patch panels. Often, rack-mounted equipment is also housed in an MDF.

-   A traditional MDF may exist in a dedicated room or a within rack space in a datacenter.
-   An MDF is usually located on the bottom floor or basement of a building.
-   All internet or WAN demarcation points are normally near or within the MDF.

A traditional intermediate distribution frame (IDF) is a smaller wiring distribution frame or rack within a building. Like an MDF, the room that houses the IDF along with networking patch panels and rack-mounted equipment is called an IDF.

-   IDFs are typically located on each floor directly above the MDF, although additional IDFs can be added on each floor as necessary.
-   IDFs located above the MDF are connected using a vertical cross connect (VCC) or wire bundles that run vertically between the MDF and an IDF.
-   If a floor has more than one IDF, the IDFs are connected with a horizontal cross connect (HCC).

BIX is a cross-connect system made of different sizes of punch down blocks, cable distribution accessories (such as moulded rings and strips), and a punch down tool. The BIX cross-connect system is certified for Category-5e and is primarily composed of two parts, the mounts and the connectors.

## Punch Down Blocks

Punch down blocks are the predecessors to patch panels. They are commonly used to support low-bandwidth Ethernet and telephony wiring.
|Block Type|Description|
|-|-|
|66 block![A 66 block is a punch down block used to connect individual copper wires together](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_wire_distribution_np6/66.png)  |A _66 block_ is a punch down block used to connect individual copper wires together.<br><br>-   The 66 block has 25 rows of four metal pins. Pushing a wire into a pin pierces the plastic sheath on the wire, making contact with the metal pin.<br>-   There are two different 66 block configurations:<br>--   In the 25-pair block (also called a non-split block), all four pins are bonded (electrically connected). Use the 25-pair block to connect a single wire with up to three other wires.<br>    --   With the 50-pair block (also called a split block), each set of two pins in a row are bonded. Use the 50-pair block to connect a single wire to one other wire.<br>- With a 50-pair block, use a bridge clip to connect the left two pins to the right two pins. Adding or removing the bridge clip is an easy way to connect wires within the row for easy testing purposes.<br><br>66 blocks are used primarily for telephone applications. When used for data applications:<br>-   Be sure to purchase 66 blocks rated for Cat 5.<br>-   When inserting wires in the block, place both wires in a pair through the same slot to preserve the twist as much as possible.
|110 block![A 110 block is a punch down block used to connect individual wires together](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_wire_distribution_np6/110.png)  |A _110 block_ is a punch down block used to connect individual wires together.<br><br>-   The 110 block comes in various sizes for connecting pairs of wires (for example 50, 100, or 300 pair).<br>-   The 110 block has rows of plastic slots. Each plastic slot connects two wires together.<br>--   Place the first wire into the plastic slot on the 110 block. <br>--   Insert a connecting block over the wire and slot. The connecting block has metal connectors that pierce the plastic cable sheath.<br>--   Place the second wire into the slot on the connecting block.<br>-   C4 connectors connect four pairs of wires; C5 connectors connect five pairs of wires.<br>-   When connecting data wires on a 110 block, you typically connect wires in the following order:<br>--   White wire with a blue stripe followed by the solid blue wire.<br> --   White wire with an orange stripe followed by the solid orange wire.<br>--   White wire with a green stripe followed by the solid green wire.<br>--   White wire with a brown stripe followed by the solid brown wire.<br><br>110 blocks are used primarily for telephone applications. They are preferable over 66 blocks in high-speed networks because the introduce less crosstalk. When used for data applications:<br><br>-   Be sure to purchase 110 blocks that are certified for Cat 5, Cat 6 and Cat 6a.<br>-   When inserting wires, preserve the twist as much as possible.
|Krone LSA-PLUS![A krone connector is a punch down block used for telecommunications. It's an European alternative to the 110 block.](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_wire_distribution_np6/krone.jpg)  |Krone is an insulation-displacement connector for telecommunications. It's a European alternative to the 110 block. The Krone system is also used in broadcast systems with audio interconnections. The krone wiring can be used with associated control systems as well. Multipair audio cables are specifically designed for the krone system.
Use a punch down tool to insert wires into 66, 110, or krone blocks.

![Punch down tool to insert wires into blocks](https://cdn.testout.com/_version_6023/netpro2021v6-en-us/en-us/resources/text/t_wire_distribution_np6/pdtool.jpg)

-   The punch down tool pushes the wire into the block and cuts off the excess wire.
-   Be sure to position the blade on the side of the clip toward the end of the wire.
-   The blade for a 66 block is straight, while the blade for a 110 block is notched.

## Patch or Distribution Panels
In an MDF or IDF, punch down blocks are rarely used for network cabling. Instead, twisted pair cables are terminated at a patch panel.

-   Typically, individual four-pair cables are used rather than 25-pair or 100-pair cables. This takes advantage of cable shielding and minimizes cross-talk.
    -   In large applications, bundles of 25- and 100-pair cables can be used for VCCs and HCCs. However, they should be certified to support the desired network speed.
-   Twisted pairs are connected at the rear of the panel with connections similar to punch down blocks. A special tool is usually required.

## Documenting MDF, IDF, and Patch Panels

Keeping an MDF or IDF organized is a major challenge. One key to doing so is proper documentation. Here are some guidelines:

-   Develop a naming convention and use it to label cables, wall jacks, patch panel ports, network devices, and racks.
-   Record names in tables and diagrams.
    -   Include location, installation dates, cable lengths, and cable grades.
    -   Consider using documentation software. Perform an internet search for cable plant documentation software or cable management software to view available options.
