# OSI model
## Open System Interconnection
### Seven Layers
1. Physical Layer
	1. Wire, electrical, radio, light
2. Data Link
	1. MAC address
	2. Frame
3. Network
	1. IP
		1. IPv4 = 2^32
		2. IPv6 = 2^128
	2. Packets
4. Transport
	1. TCP (port)
	2. Responsible for reliable delivery
5. Session
6. Presentation
7. Application

## Why?
1. Makes it easier to study a single layer
2. Better evolution of that technology

Note: TCP/IP makes layers 5 Session, 6 Presentation, and 7 Application into a single Application layer

### Server side applications have specific ports:
1. Port 80 is what Apache listens for
2. FTP uses port 21
3. SFTP uses port 22
Source (client side) port is randomly generated from your browser

# Classes
1. A, B, C
2. Messiah has a class B (So does Penn State)
## Distribution in first octet in IPv6 
1. Class A
	1. 0-127
2. Class B
	1. 126-191
	2. Messiah = 153
3. Class C
	1. 192-223
 
- Class C has access to the first three octets
- Class B has access to the first two octets
- Class A has access to the first octets

# NAT - Network Address Translation
- Router that is the gateway outside of the organization
- 10. is a class A 
-
