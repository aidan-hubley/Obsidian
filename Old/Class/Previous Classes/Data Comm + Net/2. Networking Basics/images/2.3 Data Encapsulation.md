# Data Encapsulation
Encapsulation is the process of breaking a message into packets; adding control and other information; and then transmitting the message through the transmission medium.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Data encapsulation TCP/IP model
-   Destination host
-   Data encapsulation key points
-   Data encapsulation OSI model

### Data Encapsulation TCP/IP Model

The following graphic gives you a high-level view of data encapsulation using the TCP/IP model. The callout numbers refer to the numbered descriptions below the graphic.

1.  The Application layer prepares the data to be sent through the network.
2.  The Transport layer breaks the data into pieces called segments. The Transport layer adds sequencing and control information.
3.  The Internet layer converts the segments into packets. The Internet layer adds logical network and device addresses.
4.  The Link layer converts the packets into frames. The Link layer adds physical device addressing information and a frame check sequence (FCS) footer for error detection. It also converts the frames into bits (0s and 1s) for transmission across the transmission media.

### Destination Host
On the destination host, the process operates in reverse, with bits from the network medium sent to the Link layer and processed up the model to the destination Application layer.

### Data Encapsulation Key Points
The following can help you remember how data moves through the data encapsulation process.

1.  Application layer: data.
2.  Transport layer: segments.
3.  Internet layer: packets containing logical addresses.
4.  Link layer: framing that adds physical addresses and bits that are transmitted on the network medium.

### Data Encapsulation OSI Model
The encapsulation process works in the same manner using the OSI model. As data travels through the OSI model layers, it is broken into segments at the Transport layer. Logical addresses are added at the Network layer, making each segment a packet. The Data Link layer creates frames from each packet using the physical device (MAC) address. Frames are converted to bits at the Physical layer.


## Network Communication Process Facts
### IP-based Communications
During IP-based communications between two network hosts, the following processes occur:

1.  The data to be transferred is encapsulated on the sending host by moving from the top layer of the TCP/IP or OSI model to the bottom.
2.  The data is transmitted on the network medium.
3.  If necessary, the data is transferred to various routers that forward the data to the appropriate network.
4.  The data is delivered to the destination host.
5.  The received data is de-encapsulated on the destination host by moving from the bottom layer of the TCP/IP or OSI model to the top.

### Process Details
This process is detailed in the following table:

|Process Steps|Description|
|-|-|
|Source Host Encapsulation|The data to be transferred is encapsulated on the sending host from the top layer of the TCP/IP or OSI model to the bottom. The following events occur:<br><br>1.  The Application layer prepares the data to be sent through the network by encoding it using the appropriate Application layer protocol.<br><br>2.  The Transport layer receives the data stream from the Application layer and:<br><br>-   Breaks it into smaller chunks called segments.<br>-   Adds a Transport layer header to each segment. The header identifies the source port, the destination port as well as sequencing and control information.<br><br>3.  The Internet layer converts the segments into packets by adding an Internet layer header that specifies source and destination IP addresses for each packet. IP addresses are 32-bit (4-byte) logical address that can be assigned, unassigned, and reassigned as needed.<br><br>4.  The Link layer converts the packets into frames by adding a Link layer header that specifies source and destination media access control (MAC) addresses for each frame. A MAC address:<br<br><br>-   Is a 48-bit (6-byte) address that is physically assigned in the firmware of all network interfaces.<br>-   Uniquely identifies each interface on the network.<br> -   Is displayed using hexadecimal notation.<br><br>5.  Each frame is converted into bits and transmitted across the network media.
|Network transmission |The source and destination IP addresses are used to determine whether the hosts reside on the same network or on different networks: <br><br> -   If they reside on the same network, the data can be sent directly to the destination host. The Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is used to determine the MAC address of the host using the destination IP address:<br>   <br> 1.  The sending host checks its ARP cache to see if it already has an IP-to-MAC address mapping for the host. If so, it transmits the frames to the destination host's MAC address. If not, it must use the remaining steps to determine the appropriate MAC address.<br><br>    2.  The sending host sends out an ARP broadcast frame addressed to all MAC addresses on the subnet to ask for the hardware address of the host with the destination IP address.<br><br>    3.  The host with the destination IP address responds to the ARP broadcast with a unicast transmission containing its MAC address. All other hosts ignore the broadcast.<br><br>    4.  The sending host caches the destination host's MAC address in its ARP cache.<br><br>    5.  The source MAC address of the frames is set to the MAC address of the sending system and the destination MAC address is set to the MAC address of the receiving system.<br><br>    6.  The sending host transmits the frames to the destination host's MAC address.<br><br> - If they reside on different networks, the packets must be forwarded from router to router until they reach the appropriate destination network and host. The following occurs in this situation:<br><br>    1.  If it's not already cached, the source system uses ARP to determine the MAC address of the first hop router interface that is connected to the same network segment as the source host (usually the default gateway router).<br><br>    2.  The source MAC address of the frames is set to the MAC address of the sending system, but the destination MAC address is set to the MAC address of the router interface identified with ARP.<br><br>    3.  The frames are transmitted to the first router.4.  The first router:<br><br>        ---   Removes the frame header information and examines the packets in the transmission for their source and destination IP addresses.<br>        ---   Uses ARP to discover its MAC address (if it's not already cached and if the destination host is on a network that is directly connected to the router).<br>        ---   Re-encapsulates the packets in new frames with the destination host's MAC address.<br>        ---   Transmits the frames directly to the destination host.<br><br>- If the destination host is not on a directly-connected network, the remaining steps occur.<br>5.  The router uses its routing table to determine the next router the packets should be sent to.<br>6.  The router re-encapsulates the packets in the transmission in new frames.<br>7.  The source MAC address of the frames is set to the MAC address of the local router interface and the destination MAC address is set to the MAC address of the next hop router interface.<br>8.  The router transmits the frames to the MAC address of the next hop router interface.<br><br>-   The routing process repeats until the packets arrive at a router that is directly connected to same network as the destination host.<br>-   The router receives the frames and removes the frame headers.-   The router examines the packets. It recognizes that the destination host resides on a network that is directly connected to the router.<br>-   If necessary, the router uses ARP to determine the MAC address of the destination system.<br>-   The router re-encapsulates the packets in new frames. The source MAC address of the frames is set to the MAC address of the router interface. The destination MAC address is set to the MAC address of the destination host.<br>-   The frames are transmitted to the destination host. |
| Destination host de-encapsulation | The data received is de-encapsulated on the destination host by moving from the bottom layer of the TCP/IP or OSI model to the top.<br><br>1.  The Link layer converts bits received on the network medium into frames and passes them to the Internet layer.<br>2.  The Internet layer extracts the packets from the frames and passes them to the Transport layer.<br>3.  The Transport layer receives packets and uses sequencing and error control information to request retransmission of any missing or damaged packets.<br>4.  The Transport layer uses sequencing information to convert the packets into segments and passes them to the Application layer.<br>5.  The Application layer uses the appropriate Application layer protocol to convert the segments back into the original data stream from the application on the source host.

### MTU
If there are multiple paths to a distant network, a routing protocol assigns a metric to each directly connected network link. The metric value can be thought of as the cost of sending a packet over that link. The metric is used when determining the best path to a network.

The maximum transmission unit (MTU) setting on a router determines the maximum payload size for a frame. While payload size is not usually included in a metric, it is sometimes used as a tie-breaker when two links or paths have the same cost.

## Three-Way Handshake and TCP Flags and Facts
TCP is a connection-oriented protocol that uses a three-way handshake to establish a connection with a system port. When examining a TCP packet, youâ€™ll notice the flag indicators. Two of these indicators are SYN and ACK. SYN starts a connection between two systems. ACK acknowledges that a packet has been received. There are other flag options as well. You can turn any of these indicators on or off using a packet crafter.

This lesson covers the following topics:

-   Three-way handshake
-   TCP flags

### Three-Way Handshake
The three-way handshake occurs when TCP tries to connect to make a secure connection. As indicated by the name, the handshake has three steps:

1.  Computer 1 sends a SYN packet to Computer 2.
2.  Computer 2 receives the packet and sends a SYN/ACK packet to Computer 1.
3.  Computer 1 receives the SYN/ACK packet and replies with an ACK packet. The connection is then complete.

### TCP Flags
The following table describes TCP flags.

|Flag|Description|
|-|-|
|SYN|Starts a connection between hosts|
|ACK|Acknowledges the receipt of a packet|
|FIN|Indicates that no additional information will be sent|
|RST|Resets a connection|
|URG|Flags a packet as urgent|
|PSH|Directs the sending system to send buffered data|
