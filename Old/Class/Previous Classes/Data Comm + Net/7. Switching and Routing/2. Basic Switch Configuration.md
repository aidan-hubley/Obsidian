# VLAN Functions and Features
By default, every port on a Layer 2 switch belongs to the same broadcast domain. This means if one host in a LAN sends a frame addressed to the broadcast MAC address, the switch replicates the frame to all the other active ports on the switch.

When working with VLANs, keep in mind:

-   To create a VLAN, assign individual ports on the switch to the broadcast domain desired.
-   Each port can be assigned to only one VLAN.
-   The traffic in each VLAN on a switch will be isolated from traffic from any other VLAN.
-   Packets from one VLAN can be forwarded to another VLAN only through a Layer 3 device such as a router or Layer 3 switch.
-   Each VLAN has its own MAC address table.

The following table describes VLAN features.

Creating VLANs with switches offers the following administrative benefits.

-   You can create virtual LANs based on criteria other than physical location (such as workgroup, protocol, or service).
-   You can simplify device moves. Move devices to new VLANs by modifying the port assignment.
-   You can control broadcast traffic based on logical criteria. Only devices in the same VLAN receive broadcast traffic.
-   You can control security (isolate traffic within a VLAN).

## Auto-MDIX

Auto-MDIX detects if crossover is needed for MDI/MDI-X ports. Important information about connecting network devices is as follows:

-   Each cable and port have both transmission pins and receiving pins.
-   A cable's transmission pins must connect to a port's receiving pins; a port's transmission pins must connect to a cable's receiving pins.
-   An Ethernet port connection is called a medium-dependent interface (MDI).
-   The MDI is comprised of a physical connection and a electrical connection.
-   An medium-dependent interface crossover (MDI-X) is an interface that has the transmission pins and the receiving pins in an opposite position to the MDI interface.
    -   This interface allows a straight-through cable to connect the devices where one port is an MDI port and the other is an MDI-X port.
    -   Often end devices have MDI ports; switches and hubs have MDI-X ports.
-   If you have devices that have the same interface (MDI to MDI), a crossover cable can be used to connect the devices.
-   Auto-MDI-X can automatically detect the needed cable connection type and configure the connection accordingly.
    -   When Auto-MDI-X is enabled on either end of the link, the transmission will work with either a straight-through cable or a crossover cable.
    -   For Auto-MDI-X to work properly, be sure to set the interface speed and the duplex to auto.

# CLI Switch IP Configuration Facts
## Configure Switch IP Addresses
Keep in mind the following facts about IP addresses configured on switches:

-   Basic switches operate at Layer 2. They can perform switching functions with no IP address configured.
-   A switch does not need to have an IP address configured unless you want to manage it with an in-band management utility such as SSH or a web-based interface.
-   Switch ports do not have IP addresses unless the switch performs Layer 3 switching, which is not supported on all switches.
-   The switch itself has only one active IP address. The IP address identifies the switch as a host on the network.

To configure the switch IP address, set the address on the VLAN interface (a logical interface defined on the switch to allow management functions). By default, the VLAN is VLAN 1. Use the following commands to configure the switch IP address:

> switch#config terminal  
>   
> switch(config)#interface vlan 1  
>   
> switch(config-if)#ip address _IP_address subnet_mask_  
>   
> switch(config-if)#no shutdown

## Enable Management from a Remote Network
To enable management from a remote network, configure the default gateway. Use the following command in global configuration mode:

> switch(config)#ip default-gateway _IP_address_

> You can use the **ip address dhcp** command to configure a switch (or a router) to get its IP address from a DHCP server. The DHCP server can be configured to deliver the default gateway and DNS server addresses to the Cisco device as well. A manually configured default gateway address overrides any address received from the DHCP server.

> You can use the **show cdp neighbors detail** command to display detailed information about neighboring devices including network address, enabled protocols, hold time, and software version.
