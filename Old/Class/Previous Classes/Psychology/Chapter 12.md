# Social Psychology
- Scientific studies of how individuals behave, think, and feel in social situations; how people act in the presence (actual or implied) of others
- **Need to Affiliate**: Desire to associate with other people; appears to be a basic human trait

## Attraction
- **Interpersonal Attraction**: Social attraction to another person
- **Physical Proximity**: Physical nearness to another person in terms of housing, school, work
- **Similarity**: Extent to which two people are alike in terms of age, education, attitudes, and so on
- **Mere Expose Effect**: The tendency to feel positively towards stimuli we have frequently seen

## Evolution and Mate Selection
- The approach to psychology that aims to discover and understand why the mind is designed the way it is
- **Adaptive Problems**: The issues that ancestors had to successfully deal with in order to survive and reproduce
- Our ancestors had adaptive solutions (called adaptations) that they passed on to successive generations to help them survive and **reproduce**

### International Study of Mate Preferences
- **Buss (1989)**
	- 37 samples of people
	- 10,047 subjects
		- Drawn from 33 countries
		- Located on 6 continents
	- Rated 18 characteristics on a 4-point scale ranging from
		- 0 = irrelevant
		- 3 = indispensable

### Preferences that both sexes prefer in a long term mate:
- Mutual attraction-love
- Dependability
- Emotional-stability & maturity
- Exciting personality
- Healthy
- Pleasing disposition
- Sociable
- Refinement - Neatness
- Wants children
- Easy going
- Create & artistic

### Women's Mate Preferences
- Good Financial Prospects (GFPs)
	- Cross-culturally and women value this about twice as much as men do. Why?
- High Social Status
	- In the vast majority of the 37 cultures, women rated this as more important than men did. Why?
- Ambition and Industriousness 
	- In the vast majority of the 37 cultures, women valued this as more important than men did.
- Older Men
	- In ALL 37 cultures, women preferred older men - roughly 3.5 years older than themselves
	- With age comes: resources, physical strength, hunting prowess, wisdom, maturity

### Men's Mate Preferences
- Youth
	- In ALL 37 cultures, men preferred younger women - roughly 2.5 years younger than themselves
- Physical Attractiveness
	- Men rate attractiveness as important in a LTM whereas women rate it as desirable but not crucial. Why?
	- Characteristics of physical attractiveness are correlated with health
	- Waist-to-hip ratio: 0.7
	- Women's look signal their **reproductive value** and **fertility**and men's looks do not 

### Are Women More Choosy than Men?
- Go out tonight?
	- Men 56%
	- Women 56%
- Come over to my apartment?
	- Men 69%
	- Women 6%
- Go to bed with me?
	- Men 75%
	- Women 0%


## Social Influence
- A chance in behavior caused by real or imagined pressures from others 

### 3 Types of Social Influence
1. **Conformity** - changing one's behavior to match the responses or actions of other
	- no pressure necessarily
	- Solomon Asch (1955)
	- What would you say if you were in a group of 6 others, and all agreed the on a specific answer (out loud)?
		- When alone 95% of participants answered every trial correctly
		- But 75% went against their own eyes at least once if the group gave a wrong answer
2. **Compliance** - changing one's behavior in response to a direct request
	- **Foot-in-the-door technique** - increases compliance with a large request by first getting compliance with a smaller, related request
	- **Door-in-the-face technique** - A person who has refused a major request will be more likely later on to comply with a smaller request
	- **Low-ball technique** - Commitment is gained first to reasonable or desirable terms, which are then made less reasonable or desirable
3. **Obedience** - Changing one's behavior in response to a directive from an authority figure
	- Stanley Milgram (student of Asch) performed a series of studies on the Obedience to Authority
	- Experiments were conducted at Yale from 1961-1962
	- Participant = teacher
	- Confederate = learner 
	- Task = word recall
	- Mistake = learned receives shock from teacher
		- With each mistake shock increased by 15 volts

## Groups
- **Group Cohesiveness** - Degree of attraction among group members or their commitment to remain in the group
- **Groupthink** - Compulsion by decision makers to maintain agreement, even at the cost of critical thinking
	- It is a danger that lies in powerful pressures group cohesion
- **Group Sanctions** - Rewards and punishments administered by groups to enforce conformity or punish nonconformity
- **Escalation of Commitment** - Investing (time, money) to a failing course of action
- **Bystander Effect** - Tendency for a bystander to be less likely to help in an emergency if there are other onlookers present
- **Diffusion of responsibility** - Tendency for each group member to dilute personal responsibility for acting by spreading it among all other group members

### **Darley & Latane (1968)**
- Via an intercom, NYC college students heard another student having a seizure
- Independent variable - number of other people subject knew could help
	- No others = 85% of subjects helped
	- 1 other present = 62% of subjects helped
	- 4 others present = 31% of subjects helped

## Attribution Theory
- We make 2 types of attributions
1. **Internal attributions**: explanations based on an individual's personality
	- she's weird, she's okay, she's carefree
	- These are dispositional
2. **External attributions**: explanations based on the current situation
	- She's out of laundry money, she lost a bet
	- These are situational

### Fundamental Attribution Error
- We tend to make internal attributions for a person's behavior **despite the presence of possible external influences**
- The tendency for observers to:
	- **Overestimate** the causal influence of **personality** factors on behavior
	- And to **underestimate** the causal role of situational influences

### Stanford Prison Study
- Philip Zimbardo
- Aimed to show that situational (environmental) rather than dispositional factors (personality) caused negative behavior and thoughts patterns found in prisons
- Conducted a prison simulation with participants playing the roles of guard and prisoner
- 24 Participants - half randomly assigned to be prisoners, other half randomly assigned to be guards
- The "prisoners" were arrested by local police
- Guards had complete control over the prisoners but were given no specific instructions
- Every guard at some time or another behaved in an abusive, authoritarian way
- The participants appeared to forget that they were only acting

## Cognitive Dissonance Theory
- We experience **cognitive dissonance** (an unpleasant state of psychological arousal) when there's an inconsistency within our important attitudes and behavior
- To relieve ourselves of this tension we need to change our attitude or change our behavior
