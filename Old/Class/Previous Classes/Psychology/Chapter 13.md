# Personality
- **Personality**: A person's unique and relatively stable behavior patterns; the consistency of who you are, have been, and will become
- Personality psychologists aim to understand the ways in which, and reasons why, people **differ**

## Personality Types and Carl Jung
- Carl Jung, Swiss psychiatrist, believed that we are one of two personality types: 
	- **Introverts** (I): are people who prefer their internal world of thoughts, feelings, fantasies, dreams
	- **Extroverts** (E): prefer the external world of things and people and activities 
-- Dr. Brockman says "she gets so much energy from college students but not from her lunch duty aged students (middle school)" --
- Jung suggested there are four basic ways **that we deal with the world**:
	- **Sensing** (S): getting information by means of the senses
	- **Intuiting** (N): getting information from the patterns and possibilities in the information they receive
	- **Thinking** (T): making decisions by evaluating information or ideas rationally, logically
	- **Feeling** (F): making decisions by evaluating information by weighing one's overall, emotional response

## Personality Types and the Myers-Briggs
- **Myers-Briggs Type Indicator**: one of the most popular, and most studied personality tests is based off of Jung's typology. The test has four scales:
	- **Extroversion - Introversion** (E-I): "Favorite world"
		- 75% of the population is extroverted
		-- Dr. B suggested that introverts might feel this difference heavier than extroverts
	 - **Sensing - Intuiting** (S-N): information
		 - About 75% of the population sensing
	 - **Thinking - Feeling** (T-F): Decisions
		 - 2/3rds of men are thinkers
		 - 2/3rds of women are feelers
	 - **Judging - Perceiving** (J-P): Structure
		 - **Judging**: prefer a planned or orderly way of life, like to have things settled and organized 
		 - **Perceiving**: prefer a flexible and spontaneous way of life, and like to understand and adapt to the world rather than organize it
		 - Not one of Jung's original dimensions
		 - J and P are equally distributed in the population

## The Trait Approach
- Holds that people have traits that can be measured and studied
- **Trait**: durable disposition to behave in a particular way in a variety of situations

### Gordon Allport and Traits
- **Common Traits**: Characteristics shared by most members of a culture
- **Cardinal Traits**: So basic that all of a person's activities can be traced back to the trait
- **Central Traits**: Core qualities of a personality
- **Secondary Traits**: Inconsistent or superficial aspects of a person

## The "Big Five" Personality Factors
- The **five-factor theory** of personality by McCrae and Costa (1997) is the most recent addition to trait theory. They believe in five core dimensions
	- Openness to Experience-creative & willing to try new things
	- **Conscientiousness** - reliable, responsible, thorough, dependable, hard-working
	- Extraversion - outgoing, social, active

## Psychoanalytic Theory and Sigmund Freud MD
- **Psychoanalytic Theory**: Freudian theory of personality that emphasizes unconscious forces and conflicts
- According to Freud, traumatic experiences force thoughts into our unconscious
- Psychoanalysis could bring such thoughts into the conscious mind

### Freud's Psychoanalytic Theory: 
#### The ID
- Innate biological instincts and urges; self-serving, irrational, and totally unconscious
- Works on Please Principle: Wishes to have its desires (pleasurable) satisfied NOW, without waiting and regardless of the consequences

#### The Ego
- Executive; directs ID energies
- The ego has the power to direct behavior by relating the desires of the id to external reality
- Works on Reality Principle: Delays action until it is practical and / or appropriate

#### The Superego
- Judge or censor for thoughts and actions of the ego
- Two parts:
	- **Conscience**: Reflects actions for which a person has been punished
	- **Ego Ideal**: Second part of the superego; reflects behavior one's parents approved of or rewarded

### Freudian Personality Development: 
#### Oral Stage
- Ages 0-1
	- Most of infant's pleasure comes from stimulation of the mouth
- If a child is overfed or frustrated, oral traits will develop
- Fixation leads to eating, drinking, and smoking

#### Anal Stage
- Ages 1-3
	- Child can gain approval or express aggression by letting go or holding on
- Harsh or lenient toilet training can make a child:
	- Anal Retentive: Stubborn, stingy, orderly, and compulsively clean
	- Anal Expulsive: Disorderly, messy, destructive, or cruel

#### Phallic Stage
- Ages 3-6
	- Child now notices and is physically attracted to opposite sex parent. 
- Can lead to:
	- Oedipus Conflict: For boys only. Boy feels rivalry with his father for this mother's affection
	- Electra Conflict: Girl loves her father and competes with her mother

#### Latency Stage
- Ages 6-puberty. 
	- Psychosexual development is dormant. Same sex friendships and play occur here

#### Genital Stage
- Puberty-on
	- Realization of full adult sexuality occurs here; sexual urges re-awaken


## Defense Mechanisms
-- Will be on test --
- The ego's protective methods of reducing anxiety by unconsciously distorting reality
1. **Repression** banishes anxiety-arousing thoughts, feelings, and memories from consciousness
2. **Regression** leads an individual faces with anxiety to retreat to a more infantile psychosexual stage
3. **Reaction Formation** causes the ego to unconsciously switch unacceptable impulses into their opposites
4. **Projection** leads people to disguise their own threatening impulses by attributing them to others
5. **Rationalization** offers self-justifying explanations in places of the real, more threatening, unconscious reasons for one's actions
6. **Displacement** shifts sexual or aggressive impulses toward a more acceptable or less threatening object or person, redirecting anger toward a safer outlet
7. **Denial** blocking external events from awareness. If a situation is too much to handle, the person refuses to experience it
8. **Sublimation** the transforming of a socially unacceptable behavior, whether it be sex, anger, or fear, into a socially acceptable and productive form
