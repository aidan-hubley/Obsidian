# 7.1 Crustal Deformation
1. Deformation is a general term that refers to all changes in the shape or position of a rock body in response to stress
2. Rock or geologic structures are the features that result from forces generated by the interactions of tectonic plates
	1. Included folds, faults, and joins
# What causes Rocks to Deform?
1. Stress: the force that deforms rocks
	1. Types of stress
		1. Compressional stress squeezes a rock and shortens a rock body
		2. Tensional stress pulls apart a rock unit and lengthens it 
		3. Shear stress produces a motion similar to slippage that occurs between individual playing cards when the top of the stack is moved relative to the bottom
	2. Strain: a change in shape caused by stress
		1. Strain is the change in shape of a rock caused by differential stress
		2. Strained bodies lose their original configuration during deformation
# Types of Deformation
1. Elastic, brittle, and ductile deformation
	1. Elastic deformation: The rock returns to nearly its original size and shape when the stress is removed
	2. Once the elastic limit (strength) of a rock is surpassed, it either bends (ductile deformation) or breaks (brittle deformation)
# Factors That Affect How Rocks Deform
1. Temperature: higher temp causes ductile deformation, cooler rocks causes brittle deformation
2. Confining pressure: squeezes rocks, making them stronger and harder to break
3. Rock type: crystalline igneous rocks, generally experience brittle deformation, whereas sedimentary and metamorphic rocks with zones of weakness generally experience ductile deformation
4. Time: forces applied over a long period of time generally result in ductile deformation
# 7.2 Folds: Rock Structures Formed by Ductile Deformation
1. Rocks are often bent into a series of wavelike undulations called folds
	1. Most folds result from compressional stresses that result in a shortening and thickening of the crust
2. Anticline and Synclines
	1. Anticlines are upfolded, arched sedimentary layers
		1. Oldest strata are in the center
	2. Synclines are downfolded or troughs of rock layers
		1. Youngest strata are in the center 
# Folds: Rock Structures Formed by Ductile Deformation
1. Anticlines and Synclines
	1. Depending on their orientation, anticlines and synclines can be described as:
		1. Symmetrical: the limbs of the fold are mirror images of each other
		2. Asymmetrical: the limbs of the fold are not identical
			1. Overturned (recumbent): one or both limbs are tilted beyond vertical
			2. Plunging: the axis of the fold penetrates the ground
2. Domes and basins
	1. Domes are upwarped circular features
		1. Oldest rocks are in the center
	2. Basins are downwarped circular features
		1. Youngest rocks are in the center
3. Monoclines
	1. Large, steplike folds in otherwise horizontal sedimentary strata
		1. As blocks of basement rocks are displaced upward, the ductile sedimentary strata
			1. As blocks of basement rocks are displayed upward, the ductile sedimentary strata drape over them
# 7.3 Faults and Joints: Rock Structures Formed by Brittle Deformation
1. Joints are fractures in rocks
2. Faults are fractures in rocks, along with motion has occurred
3. Sudden movements along faults are the cause of most earthquakes
# Dip-Slip Faults
1. Dip-Slip faults occur when movement is parallel to the inclination
	1. The hanging wall is rock surface above the fault
	2. The footwall is the rock surface below the fault
2. The vertical displacement along the fault produces long, low cliffs called fault scarps
3. Normal faults are characterized by the hanging wall moving down relative to the footwall
	1. Associated with tensional stress as the rocks pull apart
4. Larger scale normal faults are associated with fault-block mountains
	1. Example: Basin and Range Province
	2. Uplifted blocked are called horsts
	3. Down-dropped blocks are called grabens
5. Fault-block mountains
6. Half-grabens are tilted fault blocks
	1. Detachment faults represent the boundary between ductile and brittle rock units
7. Reverse faults are characterized by the hanging wall moving up relative to the footwall
	1. Associated with compressional stress as the crust shortens
8. Thrust faults have an angle less than 45 degrees, so the overlying plate moves almost horizontally
	1. Most pronounced along convergent plate boundaries
	2. Example: Alps, Northern Rockies, Himalayas, and Appalachians
# Strike-Slip Faults
1. Strike-Slip faults are characterized by placement that is horizontal and parallel to the strike of the fault
	1. Types of strike-slip faults
		1. Right-lateral: As you face the fault, the opposite side of the fault moves to the right
		2. Left-lateral: As you face the fault, the opposite side if the fault moves to the left
2. Large strike-slip faults that cut through the crust to accommodate plate motion are called transform faults
	1. Example: California's San Andreas Fault
# Joints
1. Joints are fractures in a rock where there has been no rock movement
	1. Most joins appear in parallel groups
# 7.4 Mountain Building
1. Mountain building has occurred during the recent geologic past
	1. America Cordillera
	2. The Alpine-Himalaya chain
	3. The mountainous terrains of the western Pacific
2. Older Paleozoic-age mountains
	1. The Appalachians: deeply eroded and topographically less prominent
3. Orogenesis: collection of process that produces a mountain belt
	1. Mountains that display faulted and folded rocks are compressional mountains
	2. Plate tectonics provides a model for orogenesis
		1. Earth's major mountains have formed along convergent plate boundaries
# 7.5 Subduction and Mountain Building
1. Island arc-type mountain building
	1. Results from the steady subduction of oceanic lithosphere
	2. Continued growth can result in the formation of parallel mountainous topography
		1. Consists of igneous and metamorphic
2. Andean-type mountain building
	1. Subduction beneath a continent rather than oceanic lithosphere
	2. Exemplified by the Andres Mountains
		1. Thick platform of a shallow-water sedimentary rocks
	3. Eventually, the forces that drive plate tectonics change direction and a subduction zone forms
		1. Oceanic lithosphere must be dense enough to sink
# 7.6 Collisional Mountain Belts
1. Cordilleran-type mountain building
	1. Associated with the Pacific Ocean (meaning it is unlikely to close)
		1. Subduction zones may form island arcs that will eventually collide with a continental crust
		2. The collision and accretion of small slivers of continental crust form the mountainous regions that rim the Pacific
		3. Terranes (crustal fragments of exotic material) make up much of the western US
	2. The nature of terranes
		1. Prior to accretion onto the continent, some terranes were microcontinents (similar to Madagascar)
		2. Other terranes were island arcs (similar to Japan)
	3. Accretion and orogenesis
		1. Small features on the ocean floor are subducted with the plate
		2. Large, buoyant features do not subduct, accreted onto the continent
	4. The North American Cordillera
		1. Many terranes that make up the North American Cordillera were scattered through the eastern Pacific
		2. During the breakup of Pangaea, the Farallon plate began to subduct under North America
			1. Resulted in the piecemeal additional of crustal fragments to the western side of North America
2. Alpine-type mountain building: continental collisions
	1. The zone where two continents collide is called suture
		1. Typically contains slivers of oceanic lithosphere
	2. Most compressional mountains echibit the deformation of a thick sequence of sedimentary rocks called a fold-and-thrust belt
3. The Himalayas
	1. Collision began about 50 million years ago
	2. India collided with Asia following the subduction of oceanic lithosphere
	3. Precambrian rocks of India resisted deformation, whereas the younger crustal fragments of southeast Asia were highly deformed
4. The Appalachians
	1. Of a similar origin to the mountains in the British Isles, Scandinavia, northwest Africa, and Greenland
		1. Formed from three main orogenic events that cumulated with the formation of Pangaea
