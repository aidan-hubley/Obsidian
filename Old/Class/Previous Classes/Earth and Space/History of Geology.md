# 1. What is Earth Science?
1. Earth Science: Include all the sciences that collectively seek to understand Earth and its neighbors in space.
2. Includes:
	1. Geology - literally the "study of Earth", both physical and historical
	2. Oceanography - a study of the ocean, 'water planet'
	3. Meteorology - the study of the atmosphere and the processes that produce weather
	4. Astronomy - the study of the universe
## Earth Science is Environmental Science
1. Natural Hazards: Earth processes that adversely impact society
2. Resources: Formation and occurrence of materials of great practical value
3. People Influence Earth Processes: How Humans influence Earth
## Scales of Space and Time in Earth Science
1. Geological Time
	1. Span of time since Earth's formation
	2. Earth is 4.6 billion years old
	3. Concept of "recent" is different
2. Geological Time Scale
	1. Divides history of Earth into different units 
# 1.2 The Nature of Scientific Inquiry
1. Science assumes the natural word is
	1. Consistent
	2. Predictable
2. Goal of Science
	1. To discover patterns in nature
	2. To use the knowledge to predict
## The Nature of Scientific Inquiry
1. An idea can become a 
	1. Hypothesis (tentative or untested explanation)
	2. Theory (tested and confirmed hypothesis)
	3. Paradigm (a theory that explains a large number of interrelated aspects of the natural world)
2. Scientific Method
	1. Gather facts through observation
	2. Formulate hypotheses and theories
# 1.4 Earth as a System
1. Earth's Spheres: The separate but interacting parts that affects our dynamic Earth
	1. Hydrosphere
		1. Ocean - the most prominent feature of the hydrosphere
			1. Covers 71% of Earth's surface
			2. Contains 97% of Earth's water
		2. Freshwater - streams, lakes, and glaciers, as well underground
	2. Atmosphere
		1. Thin, tenuous blanket of air
		2. One half lies below 5.6 kilometers (3.5 miles)
	3. Biosphere
		1. Includes all life
		2. Concentrated near the surface in a zone that extends from the ocean floor upward for several kilometers into the atmosphere
	4. Geosphere
		1. Solid Earth
		2. Extends from surface to the center of the planet
		3. Largest of Earth's four spheres
		4. Based on compositional differences, it consists of crust, mantle, and core
		5. Divisions of the outer portion are based on how materials behave
# 1.5 The Face of Earth
1. Ocean basis
	1. Average 3.8 kilometers (2.8 miles) below sea level
	2. Basaltic rocks
2. Continents
	1. Flat features that average 0.8 kilometers (0.5 miles) in elevation
	2. Granitic rocks
3. Major Features of Ocean Basins
4. Continental Margins
	1. Portions of seafloor adjacent to major landmasses
	2. Includes:
		1. Continental shelf - gently sloping platform extending seaward from shore
		2. Continental slope - steep drop off at edge of continental shelf
		3. Continental rise - more gradual incline, continental slope merges with thick accumulation of sediments
	4. Deep-Ocean Basins
		1. Between continental margins and oceanic ridges
		2. Abyssal plains - flat features of deep-ocean basins
		3. Deep-ocean trenches - deep depressions in ocean floor
		4. Seamounts - submerged volcanic structures
	5. Oceanic Ridge  
		1. Also called mid-ocean ridge  
		2. Includes Mid-Atlantic Ridge and East Pacific Rise  
		3. Continuous mountain belt that winds around globe  
		4. Many layers of igneous rock
	6. Mountain Belts  
		1. Principally the circum-Pacific belt and the Alps/Himalayas  
	7. Stable Interior  
		1. Shields - expansive, flat regions of deformed crystalline rock  
		2. Stable platforms - deformed rocks covered by sedimentary rocks
