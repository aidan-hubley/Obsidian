# Mobile App Requirements
## Why write a Mobile App Requirements Doc?
1. Fuzzy thoughts turn into clear statements
2. Developers begin to understand users
3. You get smooth development and prompt delivery
4. The end app is exactly what you want and even better
5. Your project is prevented from odds and ends - otherwise known as scope creep
6. You save time and money
## Introduction to Mobile App Requirements
1. What is your purpose?
2. Discovery-based
3. Incremental
4. Real-time
5. Ever evolving
6. Target market driven
7. Documented Requirement specifies dictated by employer
## What's Not in Requirements?
1. User Interface/User experience (UI/UX), including gesture support
2. App's collaboration with server, protocols, etc.
3. These are design issues and will be covered in a design document.
##  Key Mobile App Requirements Areas
1. App Vision
2. Problem/Opportunity statement
3. Target markets
4. Business model overview
5. App functionality 
6. App performance
7. Target OSs and devices
8. Competitors and differentiation
9. Known Issues
### Mobile App Vision
1. "Where there is not vision, the people perish". Proverbs 29:18
2. Vision: Who will benefit and how will they benefit?
3. Example: For the frequent traveler who wants to stay up to date on their travel plans, TripIt will actively monitor your trip plans and inform you of any relevant changes or potential issues,
### Mobile App Problem/Opportunity Statement
1. Briefly state the problems or opportunities that your mobile app is addressing
	1. What were the problems and opportunities that TripIt was addressing?
	2. How do you think this has changed over time?
	3. Why do you think it has changed over time?
2. Provide links or summaries of any evidence supporting the existence of the problem/opportunity
### Mobile App Target Markets
1. Target markets are the primary audiences you expect to use the mobile app
2. Why define your target markets? What purpose does this serve?
3. How do you decide on your target market?
4. Target markets, personas and value propositions
5. Target markets: use characteristics such as age, culture, interests, tech savviness, etc. to define one or more target markets for your mobile app
6. Personas: fictitious characters with specific characteristics and names used to represent sub-types within your target market 
	1. Perhaps based on certain attitudes, behaviors or bias people have
	2. Might also include when/where they are expected to use the app, the type of device and connection they will have, level of mobile awareness they will have, etc.
7. Value propositions: the compelling reasons each target market decides to use your mobile app
8. "If you look at the most popular apps, they fall into a pattern: Make something easier, give valuable information, save money, or entertain." Marc Parrish, Appboy
9. Good resource for Mobile App Marketing: www.mobilemarketer.com
10. Value Proposition = Why a customer buys from you
### Mobile App Business Model Overview
1. Business model overview addresses the question:
	1. How will your mobile app make money?
	2. Is the app not about making money, but providing some societal benefit?
2. Advertising
3. Freemium - Get you hooked, then charges
4. E-Commerce
5. We will be discussing the topic in detail next week
### Mobile App Functional Requirements
1. App functionality
2. Data access and management
3. Interrupt handling
4. Landscape support
5. Accessibility
6. Integration
7. Break app functionality up into groups of related functionality (called Epics in Scrum)
8. Break Epics up into individual named and described functions (called stories) to be provided by the app
9. Write functions in simple language in the form of:
	1. As a (typr of user role or system component)
	2. I need (task the user role/system component needs to be able to do)
	3. So that (the benefit the user role/system component derives from completing the task)
10. It is also good practice to prioritize Epics and Stories so that the developer can focus on building a Minimally Viable Product
11. Other functional mobile app requirements to consider:
	1. Geo-location services
	2. Push notifications
	3. Printing
	4. Landscape mode support
12. Data access and management requirements
	1. Will local data persistence be required for offline work?
		1. In design, we will discuss several options for local (on the phone) data persistence
	2. Will the mobile app need to send data from or to a server (perhaps Cloud-hosted database)?
13. Interrupt handling: What should the app do when users
	1. Suspend the app due to an interruption (ex. phone call) or mistakenly close the app?
14. Accessibility is about making the mobile app available to persons who may be visually or hearing impaired
15. Involves adding attributes in HTML page elements so images or graphs within the page can be read by screen readers
16. Also involves guidelines for font sizes, color contrasts (color blind)
17. Integration with 3rd party apps or systems are also part of the mobile app requirements
	1. Social media integration: list all social media channels you want your mobile app to interact with
	2. Calendar integration for appointments, reminders, scheduling, etc.
	3. Corporate or enterprise apps
	4. Other mobile apps
18. Mobile app performance is impacted by:
	1. Client app performance
	2. Server performance for servers the mobile app interacts with Mobile network performance and assumptions
		1. GSM, 2G, 3G, 4G, WiFi, International?
		2. Note: Mobile network performance is NOT fixed and varies as a function of concurrent users and data volumes in range of local wireless tower
### Mobile App Target OSs and Devices
1. Which mobile operating systems will you target?
	1. Android, iPhone, Blackberry, others?
2. Which versions of each operating system?
3. For each operating system, which devices will you target?
	1. Smartphones only
	2. Tablets?
	3. Low end devices?
4. Prioritize
### Mobile App Competitors and Differentiation
1. Key competitors with links and your source of differentiation and competitive advantage
### Mobile App Known Issues
1. Any major issues related to functionality, performance, usability, etc.?
2.
