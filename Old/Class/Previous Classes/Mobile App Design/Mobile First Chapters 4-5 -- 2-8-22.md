# Chapter 4 - Organization
## Mobile First: Organization Intro
1. Organizing content and actions for mobile is different than for websites
2. Four key principles
	1. Align with mobile content over navigation
	2. Relevant options for exploring'
	3. Maintain clarity and focus
## Align with Mobile Behaviors
1. Simply porting your desktop website as your mobile app does not make sense
2. You need to ask two key questions:
	1. What is mobile uniquely good at?
	2. How does this relate to the needs of the mobile user?
3. Josh Clark (Tapworthy) and Google's strategy focus on a few critical mobile behaviors
## Tapworthy Apps
1. Focus on mobile context
2. Optimize for micro-tasking
3. Use sensors to enhance local context
4. Create opportunity for exploration
5. Complex NOT EQUAL TO Complicated
6. Do one thing and do it well
## Content Over Navigation
1. In mobile, content takes precedence over navigation
2. People want immediate answers to questions not links
3. Too many mobile sites start with navigation and not content
## Relevant Options for Exploring
1. Mobile experience must include the ability for users to easily explore and pivot to relevant content
2. Don't over-clutter screen with too many navigation bars
	1. Allow header entry to take user to fuller navigation options (see ESPN)
3. Don't have bottom menus that simply repeat header menus
4. Simple anchor link in the header that jumps users to navigation options at the bottom of the page can be good design
5. Since many mobile devices have a back button, why include a back button in the app header?
6. Don't include a back button in app
7. If you need a fixed menu, better to locate it at top of app
## Maintain Clarity & Focus
1. "One eyeball and one thumb" - with mobile apps you only get people's partial attention
2. Do not present too much information and require too much input to get results
# Chapter 5 - Actions
## Actions: Introductions
1. Touch is a big thing for mobile apps and must be well done
2. Go small by going Big
	1. Make sure touch targets are appropriately sized/positioned
3. Be familiar with common touch gestures and their semantics
4. Making up for the loss of hover-based interactions
## Go small by Going BIG!
1. Common for web designers to respond to small screen sizes by just making app content smaller to fit the screen
2. You actually need to do the opposite and make things bigger
3. Fingers are imprecise pointing objects - so make actions BIG
	1. 50% of mobile app pointing errors relate to users tapping the wrong thing
4. Industry studies suggest that touch targets should be about 9mm wide and tall
5. When it comes to touch, bigger is usually better
## Where to Put Touch?
1. 70-90% of people are righty and use thumb in most cases
2. Place actions to middle/bottom of screen left to right 
3. Destructive actions should be place in outside comfort zone - in upper left corner
## Cover the Hover
1. Mouse hovering is a bad but common desktop web app practice
2. No real equivalent to hovering mobile device
3. Options to de-hover:
	1. replace hover with on-screen actions
	2. On tap or swipe, take action
	3. Eliminate all together
## Summary
1. Consider mobile use cases around lookup/find, explore/play, check-in/status and edit/create
2. focus on content first
3. Reduce navigation choices
4. Go BIG with appropriately sized & located touch targets
