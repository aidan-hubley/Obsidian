# How to code subqueries in the WHERE clause
You can use a variety of techniques to work with a subquery in a WHERE clause. You'll learn about these techniques in the topics that follow.
## How to use the IN operator
- In chapter 3, you learned how to use the IN operator to test whether an expression is contained in a list of values. One way to provide that list of values is to use a subquery as shown by figure 7-3. 
- The example in this figure retrieves the vendors from the Vendors table that don't have invoices in the Invoices table. To do that, it uses a subquery to return a list of IDs for each vendor that's in the Invoices table. Then, the main query returns some data about the vendors whose IDs aren't in that list. 
- When you use the IN operator with a subquery, the subquery must return a single column that provides the list of values. In this figure, the subquery also includes the DISTINCT keyword. That way, if more than one invoice exists for a vendor, the subquery only includes a single ID for the vendor. However, this keyword is optional and has no effect on the final result set. 
- In the previous figure, you saw that a query that uses a subquery with the IN operator can be restated using an inner join. Similarly, a query that uses a subquery with the NOT IN operator can typically be restated using an outer join. In this figure, for instance, the first query can be restated as shown in the second query. In this case, though, the first query is more readable.

### Description
- You can introduce a subquery with the IN operator to provide the list of values that are tested against the test expression. 
- When you use the IN operator, the subquery must return a single column of values. 
- A query that uses the NOT IN operator with a subquery can typically be restated using an outer join.
## How to use the comparison operators
- Figure 7-4 shows how you can use the comparison operators to compare an expression with the result of a subquery. In this example, the subquery returns the average balance due of the invoices in the Invoices table that have a balance due greater than zero. Then, it uses that value to retrieve all invoices with a balance due that's less than the average. 
- When you use a comparison operator as shown in this figure, the subquery must return a single value. In most cases, that means that it uses an aggregate function. However, you can also use the comparison operators with subqueries that return a list of values. To do that, you use the SOME, ANY, or ALL keywords as shown in the next two figures.

### The value returned by the subquery 
- 2910.947273
### The result set
![[Pasted image 20220922173807.png]]
### Description
- You can use a comparison operator in a WHERE clause to compare an expression with the results of a subquery. 
- If you code a search condition without the ANY, SOME, and ALL keywords, the subquery must return a single value. 
- If you include the ANY, SOME, or ALL keyword, the subquery can return a list of values. See figures 7-5 and 7-6 for more information on using these keywords.

## How to use the ALL keywork
- Figure 7-5 shows how to use the ALL keyword to modify the comparison operator so the condition must be true for all the values returned by a subquery. The table at the top of this figure shows how this works. Here, the values in parentheses 1·epresent the values returned by the query.
- If you use the greater than operator(>), the expression must be greater than the maximum value returned by the subquery. Conversely, if you use the less than operator ( < ), the expression must be less than the minimum value returned by the subquery. If you use the equal operator ( = ), all of the values returned by the subquery must be the same and the expression must be equal to that value. And if you use the not equal operator ( <>), the expression must not equal any of the values returned by the subquery. However, a not equal condition can be restated using the NOT IN operator, which is easier to read. As a result, it's a better practice to use the NOT IN operator for this type of condition.
- The query in this figure shows how to use the greater than operator with the ALL keyword. Here, the subquery selects the invoice_total column for all the invoices with a vendor_id value of 34. This results in a list of two values. Then, the main query retrieves the rows from the Invoices table that have invoice totals greater than both of the values returned by the subquery. In other words, this query returns all the invoices that have totals greater than 1083.58, which is the largest invoice for vendor number 34.
- When you use the ALL operator, the comparison evaluates to true if the subquery doesn't return any rows. In contrast, the comparison evaluates to false if the subquery returns only null values. 
- In many cases, you can rewrite a condition with the ALL keyword so it's easier to read. For example, you could rewrite the query in this figure to use the MAX function like this: 
- WHERE invoice_ total > (SELECT MAX(invoice_total) FROM invoices WHERE vendor_ id = 34) 
- As a result, we recommend replacing the ALL keyword with an equivalent condition whenever it makes the query easier to read.
|Condition|Equivalent expression|Description|
|-|-|-|
|x>ALL (1,2)| x>2| Evaluates to true if x is greater than the maximum value returned by the subquery.
|x<ALL (1,2)|x<1|Evaluates to true if x is less than the minimum value returned by the subquery.
|x=ALL (1,2)|(x=1) AND (x=2)| Evaluates to true if the subquery returns a single value that's equal to x or if the subquery returns multiple values that are the same and these values are all equal to x.
|x<>ALL (1,2)|x NOT IN (1,2)|Evaluates to true if xis not one of the values returned by the subquery.

### The result of the subquery

### The result set
![[Pasted image 20220922174718.png]]
### Description
- You can use the ALL keyword to test that a comparison condition is true for all of the values returned by a subquery. 
- If no rows are returned by the subquery, a comparison that uses the ALL keyword is always true. 
- If all of the rows returned by the subquery contain a null value, a comparison that uses the ALL keyword is always false.

## How to use the ANY and SOME keywords
- Figure 7-6 shows how to use the ANY and SOME keywords to test whether a comparison is true for any of the values returned by a subquery. Since both of these keywords work the same, you can use whichever one you prefer. For the sake of brevity, this figure uses the ANY keyword in its examples. However, you can substitute the SOME keyword for the ANY keyword to get the same results. 
- The example in this figure shows how you can use the ANY keyword with the less than operator. This statement is similar to the one you saw in the previous figure, except that it retrieves invoices with invoice totals that are less than at least one of the invoice totals for a given vendor. Like the statement in the previous figure, this condition can be rewritten using the MAX function, as follows:
- WHERE invoice_ total < (SELECT MAX (invoice_total) FROM invoices WHERE vendor id = 115)
- Since this statement is easier to read, we recommend using statements like this one instead of statements that use the ANY keyword whenever possible.
|Condition|Equivalent expression|Description|
|-|-|-|
|x>ANY (1,2)|x>1|Evaluates to true if x is greater than the 1.n.inimum value returned by the subquery.
|x<ANY (1,2)|x<2|Evaluates to true if xis less than the maximum value returned by the subquery.
|x=ANY (1,2)|x IN (1,2)|Evaluates to true if x is equal to any of the values returned by the subquery.
|x<>ANY (1,2)|(x<>1) OR (x<>2)|Evaluates to true if x is not equal to at least one of the values returned by the subquery.

### The result set
![[Pasted image 20220922224143.png]]
### Description
- You can use the ANY keyword to test that a condition is true for one or more of the values returned by a subquery. 
- If the subquery doesn't return any values, or if it only returns null values, a comparison that uses the ANY keyword evaluates to false. 
- The SOME keyword works the same as the ANY keyword.

## How to code correlated subqueries
- So far, all of the subqueries in this chapter have been uncorrelated subqueries. An uncorrelated subquery is executed only once for the entire query. However, you can also code a correlated subquery that's executed once for each row that's processed by the main query. This type of query is similar to using a loop to do repetitive processing in a procedural programming language like PHP or Java. 
- Figure 7-7 shows how correlated subqueries work. The example 1·etrieves rows from the Invoices table for those invoices that have an invoice total that's greater than the average of all the invoices for the same vendor. To do that, the WHERE clause of the subquery refers to the vendor_id value of the main query. That way, only the invoices for the current vendor are included in the average.
- Each time MySQL processes a row in the main query, it substitutes the value in the vendor_id column for the column reference in the subquery. Then, MySQL executes the subquery based on that value. For example, if the vendor_ id value is 95, MySQL executes this subquery: 
- SELECT AVG (invoice_ total) FROM invoic e s WHERE vendor_ id = 95
- After MySQL executes this subquery, it uses the returned value to detern1ine whether to include the current invoice in the result set. For example, for vendor 95, the subquery returns a value of 28.501667. Then, MySQL compares that value with the invoice total of the current invoice. If the invoice total is greater than that value, MySQL includes the invoice in the result set. Otherwise, it doesn't. MySQL repeats this process until it has processed each of the invoices in the Invoices table. 
- In this figure, the WHERE clause of the subquery qualifies the vendor_id column from the main query with the alias that's assigned to the Invoices table in that query. This is necessary because this statement uses the same table in the sub and main queries. So, the use of a table alias avoids ambiguity. However, if a subquery uses a different table than the main query, a table alias isn't necessary.
- Since correlated subqueri.es can be difficult to code, you may want to test a subquery separately before using it within another SELECT statement. To do that, however, you'll need to substitute a constant value for the variable that refers to a column in the outer query. That's what we did to get the average invoice total for vendor 95. Once you 're sure that the subquery works on its own, you can replace the constant value with a reference to the outer query so you can use it within a SELECT statement.

### The value returned by the subquery for vendor 95
- 28.501667
### The result set
![[Pasted image 20220922224502.png]]
### Description
- A correlated subquery is a subquery that is executed once for each row in the main query. In contrast, an uncorrelated subquery is executed only once. All of the subqueries in the previous figures are uncorrelated subqueries. 
- A correlated subquery refers to a value that's provided by a column in the main query. For each different value that's returned by the main query for that column, the subquery returns a different result. 
- To refer to a column in the main query, you can qualify the column with a table name or alias. If a correlated subquery uses the same table as the main query, you can use table aliases to re1nove ambiguity.

## How to use the EXISTS operator
- Figure 7-8 shows how to use the EXISTS operator with a subquery. This operator tests whether the subquery returns a result set. In other words, it tests whether the result set exists. When you use this operator, the subquery doesn't actually return a result set to the outer query. Instead, it returns an indication of whether any rows satisfy the search condition of the subquery. Because of that, queries that use this operator execute quickly. 
- You typically use the EXISTS operator with a correlated subquery as shown in this figure. This query retrieves all the vendors in the Vendors table that don't have invoices in the Invoices table. Although this query returns the same vendors as the queries shown in figure 7-3, it executes more quickly than either of those queries. 
- In this example, the correlated subquery selects all invoices that have the same vendor_id value as the current vendor in the outer query. Because the subquery doesn't actually return a result set, it doesn't matter what columns are included in the SELECT clause. As a result, it's customary to j11st code an asterisk. 
- After the subquery is executed, the search condition in the WHERE clause of the main query uses the NOT EXISTS operator to test whether any invoices were found for the current vendor. If not, the vendor row is included in the result set.

### Description
- You can use the EXISTS operator to test that one or more rows are returned by the subquery.
- You can use the NOT EXISTS operator to test that no rows are returned by the subquery. 
- When you use these operators with a subquery, it doesn't matter what columns you specify in the SELECT clause. As a result, you typically just code an asterisk ( * ).
