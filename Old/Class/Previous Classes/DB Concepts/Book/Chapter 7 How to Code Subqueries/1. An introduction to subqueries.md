# An introduction to subqueries
As you learned in chapter 5, a subquery is a SELECT statement that's coded within another SQL statement. Since you already know how to code SELECT statements, you already know how to code subqueries. Now you just need to learn where you can code them and when you should use them.

## Where to code subqueries 
- Figure 7-1 shows that a subquery can be coded, or introduced, in the WHERE, HAVING, FROM, or SELECT clause of a SELECT statement. In this figure, for example, the SELECT statement shows how you can use a subquery in a WHERE clause. This statement retrieves all the invoices from the Invoices table that have invoice totals greater than the average of all the invoices. To do that, the subquery calculates the average of all the invoices. Then, the search condition tests each invoice to see if its invoice total is greater than that average. 
- When a subquery returns a single value as it does in this example, you can use it anywhere you would normally use a single value. However, a subquery can also return a list of values (a result set that has one column). In that case, you can use the subque1Â·y in place of a list of values, such as the list for an IN operator. In addition, a subquery can return a table of values (a result set that has multiple columns). In that case, you can use the subquery in the FROM clause in place of a table. In this chapter, you'll learn about all of these different types of subqueries. 
- Finally, you can code a subquery within another subquery. In that case, the subqueries are said to be nested. Because nested subqueries can be difficult to read, you should use them only when necessary.
### Four ways to introduce a subquery in a SELECT statement
1. In a WHERE clause as a search condition
2. In a HAVING clause as a search condition
3. In the FROM clause as a table specification
4. In the SELECT clause as a column specification

### Description
- A subquery is a SELECT statement that's coded within another SQL statement. For this to work, you must enclose the subquery in parentheses. 
- A subquery can return a single value, a list of values ( a result set that has a single column), or a table of values (a result set that has multiple columns). 
- A subquery can be coded, or introduced, anywhere a single value, a list of values, or a table is allowed. 
- The syntax for a subquery is the same as for a standard SELECT statement. However, a subquery can't include an ORDER BY clause. 
- Subqueries can be nested within other subqueries.

## When to use subqueries
- In the last figure, you saw an example of a subquery that returns an aggregate value that's used in the search condition of a WHERE clause. This type of subquery provides for processing that can't be done any other way. However, most subqueries can be restated as joins, and most joins can be restated as subqueries as shown by the SELECT statements in figure 7-2.
- Both SELECT statements in this figure return a result set that consists of selected rows and columns from the Invoices table. In this case, only the invoices for vendors in California are returned. The first statement uses a join to con1bine the Vendors and Invoices tables so the vendor_state column can be tested for each invoice. In contrast, the second statement uses a subquery to return a result set that consists of the vendor id column for each vendor in California. Then, that result set is used with the IN operator in the search condition so only invoices with a vendor id in that result set are included in the final result set.
- So if you have a choice, which technique should you use? In general, we recommend that you use the technique that results in the most readable code. For example, a join tends to be more intuitive than a subquery when it uses an existing relationship between two tables. That's the case with the Vendors and Invoices tables used in this figure. On the other hand, a subquery tends to be more intuitive when it uses an ad hoc relationship.
- You should also realize that when you use a subquery in a WHERE clause, its results can't be included in the final result set. For instance, the second example in this figure can't be changed to include the vendor_name column from the Vendors table. That's because the Vendors table isn't named in the FROM clause of the main query. So if you need to include information fro1n both tables in the result set, you need to use a join.

### Advantages of joins
- The SELECT clause of join can include columns form both tables
- A join tends to be more intuitive when it uses an existing relationship between the two tables, such as a primary key to foreign key relationship. 
### Advantages of subqueries
- You can use a subquery to pass an aggregate value to the main query.
- A subquery tends to be more intuitive when it uses an ad hoc relationship between the two tables. 
- Long, complex queries can sometimes be easier to code using subqueries. 
### Description
- Like a join, a subquery can be used to code queries that work with two or more tables. 
- Most subqueries can be restated as joins and most joins can be restated as subqueries.
