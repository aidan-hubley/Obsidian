# How to code subqueries in other clause
Now that you know how to code subqueries in the WHERE clause of a SELECT statement, you're ready to learn how to code them in the HAVING, FROM, and SELECT clauses. 
## How to code subqueries in the HAVING clause 
When you code a HAVING clause, you specify a search condition just as you do when you code a WHERE clause. That includes search conditions that contain subqueries. To learn how to code subqueries in a HAVING clause, then, you can refer back to figures 7-3 through 7-8. 
## How to code subqueries in the SELECT clause
- Figure 7-9 shows how to use subqueries in the SELECT clause. To do that, you code the subquery in place of a column specification. As a result, the subquery must return a single value for that column. 
- In most cases, you code correlated subqueries in the SELECT clause. In this figure, for example, the subquery calculates the maximum invoice date for each vendor in the Vendors table. To do that, the subquery refers to the vendor_id column from the Vendors table in the main query. 
- Subqueries coded in the SELECT clause are typically difficult to read. As a result, you shouldn't use them if you can find another solution. In most cases, you can replace the subquery with a join. In this figure, for example, the first query can be restated as shown in the second query. This query joins the Vendors and Invoices tables, groups the rows by vendor_name, and uses the MAX function to calculate the maximum invoice date for each vendor. As a result, this query is easier to read.

### Description
- When you code a subquery in the SELECT clause, the subquery must return a single value. 
- When you code a subquery in the SELECT clause, you typically use a correlated subquery. 
- A query that includes a subquery in its SELECT clause can typically be restated using a join instead of the subquery. Because a join is usually faster and easier to read, subqueries are seldom coded in the SELECT clause. 

## How to code subqueries in the FROM clause
- Figure 7-10 shows how to code a subquery in the FROM clause. To do that, you code a subquery in place of a table specification. When you code a subquery in the FROM clause, it can return a result set that contains any number of rows and columns. This result set is sometimes referred to as an inline view. 
- Subqueries are typically used in the FROM clause to create inline views that provide summarized data to another summary query. In this figure, for example, the subquery returns a result set that contains the vendor state, the vendor name, and the sum of invoice totals for each vendor. To do that, it groups the vendors by state and name. Once the subquery returns this result set, the main query groups the result set by vendor state and gets the largest sum of invoice totals for each state. This returns the invoice total for the top vendor in each state.
- When you code a subquery in the FROM clause, you must assign a table alias to the subquery. This is required even if you don't use the table alias in the main query. In this figure, for example, the query assigns a table alias oft (for te.mporary table) to the subquery. 
- In addition, you should assign a column alias to all calculated columns in a subquery. In this figure, for example, the subquery assigns a column alias of sum_of_invoices to the result of the SUM function. That makes it easier to refer to these columns from other clauses in the subquery if you need to do that. It also makes it possible to refer to the column from the main query. In this example, for instance, the sum_of_invoices column is referred to by tl1e SELECT clause.

### Description
- A subquery that's coded in the FROM clause returns a result set that can be referred to as an inline view. 
- When you code a subquery in the FROM clause, you must assign an alias to it. Then, you can use that alias just as you would any other table name or alias. 
- When you code a subquery in the FROM clause, you should use an alias for any columns in the subquery that perform calculations. Then, the inline view can use these aliases as the column names of the table, and the main query can refer to the columns by these names.
