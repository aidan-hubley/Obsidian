# How to use MySQL Command Line Client
Before MySQL Workbench was available, programmers used a command-line tool known as the MySQL Command Line Client to connect to a MySQL server and work with it. This tool is also known as the MySQL command line. Although you may never need this tool, you shot1ld at least be aware that it exists. This tool comes with MySQL, and it can be useful if MySQL Workbench isn't installed on the system that you're using.
## How to start and stop the MySQL Command Line
- Figure 2-13 shows how to start and stop the MySQL Command Line Client in Windows. Although this figure shows the Command Prompt window that's available from Windows, you can use the MySQL Command Line Client on other operating systems too. In particular, on macOS, you can use the Terminal window to start the MySQL Command Line Client. 
- When you use Windows, there's an easy way to start the MySQL Command Line Client if you want to log in as the root user for the database server that's running on the local computer. To do that, you just select the MySQL Command Line Client command from the Start menu. Then, MySQL will prompt you for a password. If you enter the password correctly, you will be logged on to the database server as the root user. 
- In some cases, you'll need to use a command line to start the MySQL Command Line Client instead of using the Start menu. For example, you may need to do that if you want to log into a database that's running on a different computer, if you want to log in as a user other than the root user, or if you 're using another operating system such as macOS. In those cases, you can open a command line and change the directory to the bin directory for the MySQL installation. Then, you can execute the mysql command and supply the parameters that are needed to connect to the database server. 
- If the MySQL server is located on a remote computer, you can specify -h, followed by the host name of the computer, and -u, followed by a valid username. In addition, you specify -p so MySQL prompts you for a valid password. Although it can take some experimentation to get these connection parameters right, you only need to figure this out once. Once you enter a valid password for the specified username, the MySQL Command Line Client displays a welcome message and a command line that looks like this: 
	- my sql> 
- From this prompt, you can enter any statement that works with MySQL. When you're done, you can exit the MySQL Command Line Client by entering ''exit'' or ''quit'' followed by a semicolon.

### Description
- MySQL provides a command-line client program called the MySQL Command Line Client that lets you enter SQL statements that work with MySQL databases. This program is also known as the MySQL command line.
- For Windows, use a Command Prompt window to start the MySQL Command Line Client. 
- For macOS, use a Terminal window to start the MySQL Command Line Client. 
- To stop the MySQL Command Line Client, enter ''exit'' or ''quit'' at the command line, followed by a semicolon. 
- MySQL 8.0 also includes a Unicode version of the command-line client program. For more information on this program, you can refer to section 4.5.1.6.2 of the reference manual.
## How to use the MySQL Command Line Client to work with a database
- Once the MySQL Command Line Client is connected to a database server, you can use it to run SQL statements that work with the databases that are available from that server. When you enter a statement, you must end it with a semicolon. Otherwise, the mysql command line displays a second line when you press the Enter key like this: 
	- mysql> show databases 
		- ->  
- This shows that the MySQL Command Line Client is waiting for you to finish your statement. To finish a statement and execute it, you just type a semicolon and press the Enter key. 
- Figure 2-14 shows how to execute three SQL statements. Here, I entered all three of these statements in lowercase letters. That's because SQL isn't case sensitive, and lowercase letters are easier to type. 
- To list the names of the databases stored on a server, you use the SHOW DATABASES statement as illustrated by the first example. Here, the ''ap'', ''ex'', and ''om'' databases are the databases that are created when you install our downloadable databases as described in appendixes A and B. The ''information_schema'', ''performance_schema'', and ''mysql'' databases are internal databases that are used by the MySQL server. And the ''sys'' database is a database that comes with MySQL and can be used to interpret data in the ''performance_schema'' database. 
- To select the database that you want to work with, you can enter a USE statement as illustrated by the second example. Here, the AP database is selected, and the message after this statement says ''Database changed'' to indicate that the statement was successful. After you select a database, the commands and statements that you enter will work with that database. 
- To retrieve data from the database, you use a SELECT statement as illustrated by the third example. Here, the vendor_name column from the Vendors table is displayed. Note, however, that the result set is limited to only the first five rows. When you successfully execute a SELECT statement, the MySQL Command Line Client displays a message giving the number of rows that are included in the result set and the amount of time it took to run the query. In this case, it took less than 1/100 of a second to run the query.

### Description
- You can use the MySQL Command Line Client to work with any of the databases running on the database server. To do that, you can use any SQL statement that works with a MySQL database. 
- To execute a SQL statement, type the statement on the command line, followed by a semicolon. Then, press the Enter key. 
- To show a list of all available databases, you can use the SHOW DATABASES statement. 
- To select the database that you want to work with, you can use the USE statement. 
- SQL statements aren't case-sensitive. As a result, when using the MySQL Command Line Client, most programmers enter their statements in lowercase letters because they 're easier to type.
