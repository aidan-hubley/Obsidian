# Introduction to SQL and SQL-based Systems
## The SQL Statements
- In the topics that follow, you '11 learn about some of the SQL statements provided by MySQL. You can use some of these statements to manipulate the data in a database, and you can use others to work with database objects. Although you may not be able to code these statements after reading these topics, you should have a good idea of how they work. Then, you' 11 be better prepared to learn the details of coding these statements when they're presented in the rest of this book.

### Introduction to the SQL Statements
- Figure 1-10 summarizes some of the most common SQL statements. These statements can be divided into two categories. The statements that work with the data in a database are called the data manipulation language (DML). These state1nents are presented in the first group in this figure, and these are the statements that application programmers use the most. 
- The statements that create databases and work with the objects within a database are called the data definition language (DDL). On large systems, these state1nents are used exclusively by database administrators (DBAs). It's the DBA's job to maintain existing databases, tune them for faster performance, and create new databases. On smaller systems, though, the SQL programmer may fill the role of the DBA.

### Description
- The SQL statements can be divided into two categories: the **data manipulation language (DML)** that lets you work with the data in the database and the **data definition language (DDL)** that lets you work with the objects in the database
- MySQL programmers typically work with the DML statements, while **database administrators (DBAs)** use the DDL statements

## How to Work with Database Objects
- To give you an idea of how you use the DDL statements shown in the previous figure, figure 1-11 presents some examples. Here, the first example creates a database named AP. Then, the second example selects that database. As a result, the rest of the statements in this figure are run against the AP database. 
- The third example creates the Invoices table that's used throughout this chapter. If you don't understand all of this code right now, don't worry. You'll learn how to code statements like this in chapter 11. For now, just realize that this statement defines each column in the table, including its data type, whether or not it allows null values, and its default value if it has one.
- In addition, the third example defines the primary and foreign key columns for the table. These definitions are one type of constraint. Since the Invoices table includes foreign keys to the Vendors and Terms tables, these tables must be created before the Invoices table. Conversely, before you can delete the Vendors and Terms tables, you must delete the Invoices table. 
- The fourth example in this figure changes the Invoices table by adding a column to it. Like the statement that created the table, this statement specifies the attributes of the new column. Then, the fifth example deletes the column that was just added. 
- The sixth example creates an index on the Invoices table. In this case, the index is for the vendor_id column, which is used frequently to access the table. Then, the last example deletes the index that was just added.

	2. ADD balance_due DECIMAL(9,2)
4. A statement that deletes the new column
	1. ALTER TABLE invoices
	2. DROP COLUMN balance_due
5. A statement that creates an index on the table
	1. CREATE INDEX invoices_vendor_id_index
		1. ON invoices (vendor_id
6. A statement that deletes the new index
	1. DROP INDEX invoices_vendor_id_index
		1. ON invoices

## How to Query a Single Table
- Figure 1-12 shows how to use a SELECT statement to query a single table in a database. To start, this figure shows some of the columns and rows of the Invoices table. Then, in the SELECT statement that follows, the SELECT clause names the columns to be retrieved, and the FROM clause names the table that contains the columns, called the base table. In this case, six columns will be retrieved from the Invoices table. 
- Note that the last column, balance_due, is calculated from three other columns in the table. In other words, a column by the name of balance_due doesn't actually exist in the database. This type of column is called a calculated value, and it exists only in the results of the query. 
- In addition to the SELECT and FROM clauses, this SELECT statement includes a WHERE clause and an ORDER BY clause. The WHERE clause gives the criteria for the rows to be selected. In this case, a row is selected only if it bas a balance due that's greater than zero. Finally, the returned rows are sorted by the invoice date column. 
- This figure also shows the result set (or result table) that's returned by the SELECT statement. A result set is a logical table that's created temporarily within the database. When

### The Result Set Defined by the SELECT Statement
![[Pasted image 20220830001729.png]]

### Concepts
- You use the SELECT statement to retrieve selected columns and rows from a **base table**. The result of a SELECT statement is a **result table**, or **result set**, like the one shown above
- A result set can include **calculated values** that are calculated from the columns in the table
- A SELECT statement is commonly referred to as a **query**

# How to Join Data from Two or More Tables
- Figure 1-13 presents a SELECT statement that retrieves data from two tables. This type of operation is called a **join** because the data from the two tables is joined together into a single result set. For example, the SELECT statement in this figure joins data from the Invoices and Vendors tables. 
- An **inner join** is the most common type of join. When you use an inner join, rows from the two tables in the join are included in the result table only if their related columns match. These matching columns are specified in the FROM clause of the SELECT statement. In the SELECT statement in this figure, for example, rows from the Invoices and Vendors tables are included only if the value of the vendor id column in the Vendors table matches the value of the - vendor_id column in one or more rows in the Invoices table. If there aren't any invoices for a particular vendor, that vendor won't be included in the result set. 
- Although this figure shows only how to join data from two tables, you can extend this syntax to join data from three or more tables. If, for example, you want to include line item data from a table named Invoice_Line_Items in the - - results shown in this figure, you can code the FROM clause of the SELECT statement like this:
![[Pasted image 20220830002045.png]]
- Then, in the SELECT clause, you can include any of the columns in the Invoice_Line_Items table. 
- In addition to inner joins, most relational databases including MySQL support other types of joins such as outer joins. An outer join lets you include all rows from a table even if the other table doesn't have a matching row. You'll learn more about the different types of joins in chapter 4.

### Concepts
- A **join** lets you combine data from two to more tables into a single result set
- The most common type of join is an **inner join**. This type of join returns rows from both tables only if their related columns match
- An **outer join** returns rows from one table in the join even if the other table doesn't contain a matching row

# How to Add, Update, and Delete Data in a Table
- Figure 1-14 shows how you can use the INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements to modify the data in a table. In this figure, for example, the first statement is an INSERT statement that adds a row to the Invoices table. To do that, the INSERT clause names the columns whose values are supplied in the VALUES clause. 
- In chapter 5, you'll learn more about specifying column names and values. For now, just note that you have to specify a value for a column unless it's a column that allows null values or a column that's defined with a default value. 
- The two UPDATE statements in this figure show how to change the data in one or more rows of a table. The first statement, for example, assigns a value of 35.89 to the credit total column of the invoice in the Invoices table with invoice number 367447. The second statement adds 30 days to the invoice due date for each row in the Invoices table whose terms id column has a value of 4. 
- To delete rows from a table, you use the DELETE statement. For example, the first DELETE statement in this figure deletes the invoice with invoice number 4-342-8069 from the Invoices table. The second DELETE statement deletes all invoices with a balance due of zero. However, since the Invoices table has a foreign key that references the Invoice_Line_Items table, these DELETE statements won't work unless the invoice doesn't contain any line items. One way to get these DELETE statements to work is to delete the co1responding rows from the Invoice_Line_Items table first.

# Statements
1. A statement that adds a row to the invoices table
![[Pasted image 20220830002800.png]]
2. A statement that changes the value of the credit_total column for a selected row in the Invoices table
	1. UPDATE invoices
	2. SET credit_total = 35.89
	3. WHERE invoice_number = '357447'
3. A statement that changes the values in the invoice_due_date_column for all invoices with the specified terms_id
	1. UPDATE invoices
	2. SET invoice_due_date = DATE_ADD(invoice_due_date, INTERVAL 30 DAY)
	3. WHERE terms_id = 4
4. A statement that deletes a selected invoice form the Invoices table
	1. DELETE FROM invoices
	2. WHERE invoice_number = '4-342-8069'
5. A statement that deletes all paid invoices form the Invoices table
	1. DELETE FROM invoices
	2. WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total = 0

## Concepts
- You use the INSERT statements to add rows to a table
- You use the UPDATE statement to change the values in one or more rows of a table based on the condition you specify
- You use the DELETE statement to delete one or more rows from a table based on the condition you specify

### Danger
- If you're new to SQL statements, please don't execute the statements above until you read chapter 5 and understand the effect that these statements can have on the database

# SQL Coding Guidelines
- SQL is a freefor111 language. That means that you can include line breaks, spaces, and indentation without affecting the way the database interprets the code. In addition, SQL isn't case-sensitive like so1ne languages. That means that you can use uppercase or lowercase letters or a combination of the two without affecting the way the database interprets the code. 
- Although you can code SQL statements with a freeform style, we suggest that you follow the coding recommendations presented in figure 1-15. The examples in this figure illustrate the value of these coding recommendations. The first example presents an unformatted SELECT statement that's difficult to read. In contrast, this statement is much easier to read after our coding recommendations are applied as shown in the second example. 
- The third example illustrates how to code a block comment. This type of comment is typically coded at the beginning of a group of statements and is used to document the entire group. Block comments can also be used within a statement to describe blocks of code, but that's not common. 
- The fourth example in this figure includes a single-line comment. This type of comment is typically used to document a single statement or line of code. A single-line comment can be coded on a separate line as shown in this example, or it can be coded at the end of a line of code. In either case, the comment is delimited by the end of the line. 
- Although many programmers sp1·inkle their code with comments, that shouldn't be necessary if yot1 write your code so it's easy to read and understand. Instead, you should use comments only to clarify sections of code that are difficult to understand. Then, if you change the code, you should be sure to change the comments too. Otherwise, the comments won't accurately represent what the code does, which will make the code even more difficult to understand.

## A select statement with a single line comment
![[Pasted image 20220830003842.png]]

## Coding Recommendations
- Capitalize all keywords, and use lowercase for the other code in a SQL statement. 
- Separate the words in names with underscores, as in invoice_number. 
- Start each clause on a new line. 
- Break long clauses into multiple lines and indent continued lines. 
- Use comments only for portions of code that are difficult to understand. Then, make sure that the comments are correct and up-to-date.
## How to Code a Comment
![[Pasted image 20220830004039.png]]
- To code a **single-line comment**, type -- followed by the comment
## Description
- Line breaks, white space, indentation, and capitalization have no effect on the operation of a statement
- Comments can be used to document what a statement does or what specific part of the code do. They are not executed by the system
