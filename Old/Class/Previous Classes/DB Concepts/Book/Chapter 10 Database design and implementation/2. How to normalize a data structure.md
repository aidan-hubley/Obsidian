The topics that follow describe the seven normal forms and teach you how to apply the first three. As I said earlier, you apply these three forms to some extent in the first four database design steps, but these topics will give you more insight into the process. Then, the last topic explains when and how to denormalize a data structure. When you finish these topics, you'll have the basic skills for designing databases that are efficient and easy to use.
## The seven normal forms
- Figure 10-9 summarizes the seven normal forms. Each normal form assumes that the previous forms have already been applied. Before you can apply the third normal form, for example, the design must already be in the second normal form. Strictly speaking, a data structure isn't normalized until it's in the fifth or sixth normal form. However, the normal forms past the third normal form are applied infrequently. Because of that, I won't present those forms in detail here. Instead, I'll just describe them briefly so you'll have an idea of how to apply them if you need to. 
- The Boyce-Codd normal form can be used to eliminate transitive dependencies. With this type of dependency, one column depends on another column, which depends on a third coltunn. To illustrate, consider the city, state, and zip code columns in the Vendors table. Here, a zip code identifies a city and state, which means that the city and state are dependent on the zip code. The zip code, in turn, is dependent on the vendor_id column. To eliminate this dependency, you cottld store the city and state values in a separate table that uses zip code as its primary key. 
- The fourth normal form can be used to eliminate multiple multivalued dependencies from a table. A multivalued dependency is one where a primary key column has a one-to-many relationship with a non-key column. To illustrate, consider the vendor contact phone number in the Vendors table. If you wanted to accommodate alternate phone nt1mbers, such as a cellular or home phone, you could add extra columns for each type of number. However, this creates a multivalued dependency between the phone numbers and the vendor_id. To be in fourth normal fonn, therefore, you'd need to store phone numbers in a separate table that uses vendor_id as a foreign key. 
- To apply the fifth normal form, you continue to divide the tables of the data structure into smaller tables until all redundancy has been removed. When further splitting would result in tables that couldn't be used to reconstruct the original table, the data structure is in fifth normal form. In this form, most tables consist of little more than key columns with one or two data elements. 
- The domain-key normal form, sometimes called the sixth normal form, is only of academic interest since no database system has implemented a way to apply it. For this reason, even normalization purists might consider a database to be normalized in fifth normal form.

### The benefits of normalization
- Since a normalized database has more tables than an unnormalized database, and since each table has an index on its primary key, the database has more indexes. That makes data retrieval more efficient. 
- Since each table contains information about a single entity, each index has fewer columns (usually one) and fewer rows. That makes data retrieval and insert, update, and delete operations more efficient. 
- Each table has fewer indexes, which makes insert, update, and delete operations more efficient. 
- Data redundancy is minimized, which simplifies maintenance and reduces storage. 
### Description
- Each normal form assumes that the design is already in the previous normal form. 
- A database is typically considered to be normalized if it is in third normal form. The other four forms are not commonly used and are not covered in detail in this book.
- Figure 10-9 also lists the benefits of normalizing a data structure. To summarize, no1malization produces smaller, more efficient tables. In addition, it reduces data redundancy, which makes the data easier to maintain and reduces the amount of storage needed for the database. Because of these benefits, you should always consider normalizing your data structures. You should also be aware that the subject of normalization is a contentious one in the database community. In the academic study of computer science, normalization is considered a form of design perfection that should always be strived for. In practice, though, database designers and DBAs tend to use normalization as a flexible design guideline.
