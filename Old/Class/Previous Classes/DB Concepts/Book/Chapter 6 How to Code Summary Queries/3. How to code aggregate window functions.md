# How to code with aggregate window functions
In the topics that follow, you'll learn how to use the aggregate window functions that were introduced with MySQL 8.0. You can use the window functions with any of the aggregate functions you learned about in this chapter.
## How the aggregate window functions work
- Earlier in this chapter, you learned how to use some of the aggregate functions with the GROUP BY clause to group and summarize data. When you use GROUP BY, a single row is returned for each unique set of values in the grouped columns. If a result set is grouped by the vendor_id column, for example, only one row is returned for each vendor, and that vendor is summarized by the aggregate functions that are included in the SELECT clause. Aggregate window functions are similar except that the groups, or partitions, aren't collapsed to a single row. Instead, all of the rows in the result set are returned. 
- Figure 6-9 illustrates how this works. To start, you code an aggregate window function by including the OVER clause. This clause defines the window that's used by the aggregate function. A window consists of all of the rows that are needed to evaluate the function for the current row. You'll learn more about how this works as you review the examples that follow. 
- The first example in this figure shows a SELECT statement that includes two aggregate window functions. Both of these functions use the SUM function to calculate a total of the invoice_total column. However, the OVER clause for the first function is empty, which means that all of the rows in the result set are included in a single partition. Because of that, the total_invoices column contains the same value for each column, which is the total of all of the invoices in the result set. In this case, to calculate the total of all invoices, the SUM function for each row needs a window into all of the other rows in the result set. 
- By contrast, the second window function in this query uses the PARTITION BY clause to partition the result set by the vendor_id column. That way, the sum of the invoice totals is calculated for each vendor instead of for all vendors. You can see the result of this function in the vendor_total column. In this case, to calculate the total of all invoices for each vendor, the SUM function for each row needs a window into all the other rows for the same vendor. That means that if the fust row for vendor 110 is the current row, it needs a window into the other four rows for that vendor.
- If you want to sort the rows within each partition, you can code the ORDER BY clause on the OVER clause. This is illustrated by the second example in this figure. Here, the second aggregate window fi.1nction indicates that the invoices for each vendor should be sorted by the invoice_total column. If you compare the sequence of the invoices for vendor 110 in this result set with the sequence in the first result set, you shouldn't have any trouble understanding how this works.

### Description
- The window functions can be used with all of the aggregate functions listed in figure 6-1 , as well as others. 
- Unlike aggregate functions that use GROUP BY, the groups, or partitions, in an aggregate window function are not collapsed to a single row. 
- A window consists of all of the rows that are needed to calculate the aggregate value for the current row. 
- To treat an aggregate function as a window function, you include an OVER clause that indicates how to partition the rows in the result set. 
- If you code an empty OVER clause, the entire result set is treated as a single partition. 
- If you code an OVER clause with a PARTITION BY clause, the aggregate function is performed on each partition. 
- If you code an ORDER BY clause on the OVER clause, the rows within each partition are sorted and the values from one row to the next are cumulative.

-  Another difference between these two result sets are the values in the vendor_total column for vendor 110. That's because, when you code the ORDER BY clause, the frame includes all of the rows from the start of the partition through the current row. You'll learn more about defining frames explicitly in the next figure. For now, just realize that a frame consists of one or more rows within a partition relative to the current row.
- For the SUM function, this means that the column contains a cumulative total for each vendor. To see how this works, you can compare the values in the vendor total column with the values in the invoice total column for vendor - - 110. Here, the values for the first row are the same. However, the second row in the vendor_total column contains the value of the first row plus the value of the second row in the invoice total columm. The third row in the vendor total - - column contains the value of the second row plus the value of the third row in the invoice total column. And so on.

## How to use frames
- In addition to partitioning the rows in the result set for an aggregate function, you can create a frame that defines a subset of the current partition. Because a frame is relative to the current row, it can move within a partition as the current row changes. As you'll see, that makes it easy to calculate cumulative totals and moving averages. 
- Figure 6-10 shows the syntax for defining a frame. To start, you can code the ROWS or RANGE keyword. If you use ROWS, the frame is determined by the number of rows before and after the current row. If yot1 use RANGE, the frame is determined by the value of the rows before and after the current row. In some cases, you can get the same result with either ROWS or RANGE. In other cases, though, you'll need to use one or the other to get the result you want. You'll see examples of that in a minute. 
- Following the ROWS or RANGE keyword, you can specify just the starting row for the frame or both the starting and ending rows. If you specify just the starting row, the ending row is the current row. To specify both a starting and ending row, you code a BETWEEN clause. 
- To indicate where a frame starts or ends, you can code any of the values in the table shown in this figure. To illustrate, the first example in this figure shows how to define a frame that includes the first row in the partition up to and including the current row. To do that, it uses the ROWS keyword followed by a BETWEEN clause that specifies the starting and ending rows. In this case, UNBOUNDED PRECEDING indicates that the frame starts at the first row in the partition, and CURRENT ROW indicates that the frame ends at the current row. Then, because the rows in the partitions are sorted, the column contains cumulative values. 
- Note that, because the frame ends at the current row, you could also define the frame like this: 
- ROWS UNBOUNDED PRECEDING

### A SELECT statement that defines a frame
![[Pasted image 20220920201145.png]]
### Description
- A frame can be defined as the number of rows before and after the current row (ROWS) or a range of values based on the value of the current row (RANGE). 
- If you specify just the starting row for a frame, the ending row is the current row. To specify both a starting and ending row, you use the BETWEEN clause. When you use BETWEEN, the starting row for a frame must not come after the ending row. 
- If an ORDER BY clause is included in the OVER clause and you use the ROWS keyword, values are accumulated up to and including the current row as shown above.

- In that case, the ending row defaults to the current row. You can also omit the frame definition entirely, since it's the default when you include ORDER BY on the OVER clause. You saw how that worked in the previous figure. 
- Part 2 of figure 6-10 presents two more queries that use frames. The fust query is almost identical to the one in part 1 of this figure. The only difference is that it uses the RANGE keyword instead of the ROWS keyword. Because of that, the frame includes all of the rows within the partition, along with the current row and any of its peers. In this case, a peer is a row that has the same value as other rows in the sort column. In this example, for instance, the result set includes three invoices dated 2018-04-16 for vendor 123. If you look at the vendor_total column for these rows, you'll see that they all contain the same value. That's because the value of the invoice total colu1nn for all three of these rows is included in the accumulation for the rows. 
- The second example in this figure illustrates a common use for frames. Here, a moving average is calculated for the invoice totals. A moving average is an average that's calculated on the current row plus a specified number of rows before and after the current row. It's particularly useful when working with data over a period of time to eliminate short-term fluctuations so long-term trends become more obvious. 
- In this example, a three-month average is calculated for the sum of invoice totals. To do that, the RANGE keyword is coded with a BETWEEN clause that indicates that the invoice total for the current month, one month before the current month, and one month after the current month should be used to calculate the average. The three-month average for month 5, for example, is calculated by adding the values in the invoice_total column for months 4, 5, and 6 and dividing by 3. 
- Note that when you calculate a moving average, there isn't a row before the first row to include in the average. Because of that, the average for that row includes just the invoice totals for the current row and the next row. Similarly, the average for the last row includes just the invoice totals for the current row and the previous row.
- This query also uses the MONTH function in the SELECT clause, the ORDER BY clause for the OVER clause, and the GROUP BY clause. This function extracts the numeric month from a date. You'll learn about this function as well as other functions for working with dates in chapter 9.

### A SELECT statement that calculates moving averages
![[Pasted image 20220920201503.png]]
### Description
- If an ORDER BY clause is included in the OVER clause and you use the RANGE keyword, values are accumulated up to and including the current row as well as its peer rows. A peer is a row that's in the same sort sequence as other rows in the partition as shown by the first example above. 
- You can use a frame to calculate a moving average. A moving average is calculated by adding the value of the current row to the values of zero or 1nore preceding and following rows. 
- Because there are no preceding rows for the first row in a partition, the moving average for that row consists of the average of the value of the current row plus the values of the following rows. Similarly, the moving average for the last row consists of the average of the value of the current row plus the values of the previous rows.

## How to use named windows
- In some cases, you'll need to code a SELECT statement with two or more aggregate functions that use the same window. Then, you may want to use a named window so you don't have to repeat the definition for the window for each function. Figure 6-11 shows how to define and use a named window. 
- The first example in this figure shows a SELECT statement that includes four of the aggregate functions. Each function includes an OVER clause that partitions the rows in the result set by the vendor_id column. To do that, the PARTITION BY clause is repeated on each OVER clause. 
- An easier way to do this is to name the window by coding a WINDOW clause as shown in the second example. Here, the window is named vendor_ window, and it's defined with the PARTITION BY clause. Then, the four aggregate functions include just the window name on the OVER clause. In other words, they don't have to repeat the PARTITION BY clause. Note that when you code just a window name, you don't enclose it in parentheses. 
- If you review the code in this example, you might wonder why you would use a named window. After all, the code isn't any simpler since the window definition consists of only a PARTITION BY clause. The answer is that, if you wanted to change the window definition, you would only need to do it in one place. Of course, window names provide even mo1·e of an advantage as your window definitions get more complex.
- The third example in this figure shows how you can modify a window definition when you use it. To do that, you can add a PARTITION BY or ORDER BY clause or a frame definition. In this example, the named window partitions the rows in the result set by the vendor_id column just like the second example. Then, the SELECT clause includes two columns that sum the invoice totals for each vendor. Both columns use the named window, but they sort the totals in a different sequence. To do that, the window name is followed by an ORDER BY clause, and both the name and clause are enclosed in parentheses. 
- When you use named windows, you should know that you can't modify any of the clauses that are included in the window definition. For example, because the window in the third example includes a PARTITION BY clause, you can't include that clause on an OVER clause that uses the named window. Instead, you can only add to the window definition.
### The syntax for naming a window
- WINDOW window_name AS {\[partition_clause] \[order_clause] \[frame_clause]}

### A SELECT statement that adds to the specification for a named window
![[Pasted image 20220920201939.png]]
### Description
- To define a named window, you code a WINDOW clause. This clause should be coded after the HAVING clause and before the ORDER BY clause, if those clauses are included. 
- To use a named window, you code it on the OVER clause. If you code just the window name, you don't include parentheses. 
- If a WINDOW clause doesn't include a PARTITION BY or ORDER BY clause or a frame definition, you can add it to the window when you use it. To do that, you code the window name and the additional clause in parentheses after the OVER keyword.
