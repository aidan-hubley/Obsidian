# How to work with unions
Like a join, a union combines data from two or more tables. Instead of combining columns from base tables, however, a union combines rows from two or more result sets.

## How to code a union
- Figure 4-13 shows how to code a union. To start, you use the UNION keyword to connect two or more SELECT statements. For this to work, the result of each SELECT statement must have the same number of columns, and the data types of the corresponding columns in each table must be compatible. 
- In this figure, we have indented all of the SELECT statements that are connected by the UNION operator to make it easier to see how this statement works. However, in a production environment, it's common to see the SELECT statements and the UNION operator coded at the same level of indentation. 
- If you want to sort the result of a union operation, you can code an ORDER BY clause after the last SELECT statement. In an ORDER BY clause, you must use the column names that are specified in the first SELECT statement. That's because the column names in the first SELECT statement are the ones that are used in the final result set. 
- By default, a union operation removes duplicate rows from the result set. If that's not what you want, you can include the ALL keyword. In most cases, though, you'll omit this keyword.

## A union that combines result sets from different tables
- The example in figure 4-13 shows how to use a union to combine data from two different tables. In this case, the Active_Invoices table contains invoices with outstanding balances, and the Paid_Invoices table contains invoices that have been paid in full. Both of these tables have the same structure as the Invoices table that's been used in this book so far. 
- This union operation combines the rows in both tables that have an invoice date on or after June 1, 2018. Here, the first SELECT statement includes a column named source that contains a literal value of ''Active." Then, the second SELECT statement includes a column by the same name, but it contains a literal value of ''Paid." This column is used to indicate which table each row in the result set came from. 
- Although this column is assigned the same name in both SELECT statements, you don't have to use the same name for corresponding columns. That's because the corresponding relationships are determined by the order in which the columns are coded in the SELECT clauses, not by their names. When you use column aliases, though, you'll typically assign the same name to corresponding columns so the statement is easier to understand.

### Description
- A union combines the result sets of two or more SELECT statements into one result set. 
- Each result set must return the same number of columns, and the corresponding columns in each result set must have compatible data types. 
- By default, a union eliminates duplicate rows. If you want to include duplicate rows, code the ALL keyword. 
- The column names in the final result set are taken from the first SELECT clause. Column aliases assigned by the other SELECT clauses have no effect on the final result set. 
- To sort the rows in the final result set, code an ORDER BY clause after the last SELECT statement. This clause must refer to the column names assigned in the first SELECT clause.

## A union that combines result sets from the same tables
- The first example in figure 4-14 shows how to use unions to combine result sets created from a single table. In this example, rows from the Invoices table that have a balance due are combined with rows from the same table that rule paid in full. As in the previous figure, a column named source is added at the beginning of each result set. That way, the final result set indicates whether each invoice is active or paid. 
- The second example shows how to use unions to combine result sets created from the same two tables after they have been joined. Here, each SELECT state1nent joins data from the Invoices and Vendors tables. The first SELECT statement retrieves invoices with totals greater than $10,000. Then, it calculates a payment of 33% of the invoice total. The two other SELECT statements are similar. The second one retrieves invoices with totals between $500 and $10,000 and calculates a 50% payment. And the third one retrieves invoices with totals less than $500 and sets the payment amount at 100% of the total. Although this isn't the n1ost practical example, it helps illustrate the flexibility of union operations. 
- In both of these examples, the same column aliases are assigned in each SELECT statement. Although the aliases in the second and third SELECT statements are optional, they make the query easier to read. In particular, they make it easy to see that the three SELECT statements have the same number and types of columns.

## A union that simulates a full outer join
- A full outer join. returns unmatched rows from both the left and right tables. Although MySQL doesn't provide language for coding a full outer join, you can simulate a full outer join by coding a union that combines the result sets for a left outer join and a right outer join as shown in figu1Â·e 4-15. 
- The example in this figure uses the UNION keyword to combine the result sets for the left and 1ight outer joins shown in figure 4-9. As a result, this example returns all the rows from the Departments and Employees tables even if these rows don't have matching columns in the other table. 
- To make it easier to identify the unmatched rows, this statement includes the department_number column from both tables. This shows that two rows in the Employees table don't have matching rows in the Departments table, and it shows that one row in the Departments table doesn't have a matching row in the Employees table. In other words, two employees haven't been assigned to a department, and one depa1tment doesn't have any employees.

### Description
- When you use a full outer join, the result set includes all the rows from both tables. 
- MySQL doesn't provide language keywords for full outer joins, but you can simulate a full outer join by using the UNION keyword to combine the result sets from a left outer join and a right outer join.
