# Other skills for working with joins
Now that you know how to work with inner and outer joins, you 're ready to learn how to join tables with the USING and NATURAL keywords. In addition, you're ready to learn about another type of join, called a cross join.

## How to join tables with the USING keyword
- When you use the equal operator to join two tables on a common column, the join can be referred to as an equijoin (or an equi-join). When you code an equijoin, it's common for the columns that are being compared to have the same name. For joins like these, you can simplify the query with the USING keyword. To do that, you code a USING clause instead of an ON clause to specify the join as shown in figure 4-10. 
- The first example in this figure shows how to join the Vendors and Invoices tables on the vendor id column with a USING clause. This returns the same results as the query shown in figure 4-1 that uses the ON clause. However, the USING clause only works because the vendor_id column exists in both the Vendors and Invoices tables. 
- The second example shows how to join the Departments, Employees, and Projects tables with the USING keyword. Here, the first USING clause uses an inner join to join the Departments table to the Employees table on the department_number column. Then, the second USING clause uses a left join to join the Employees table to the Projects table on the employee_id column. This shows that you can use a USING clause for both inner and outer joins, and this query returns the same result as the last query shown in figure 4-9. 
- In some rare cases, you may want to join tables by multiple columns. To do that with a USING clause, you can code multiple column names within the parentheses, separating the column names with commas. This yields the same result as coding two equijoins connected with the AND operator. 
- Since the USING clause is more concise than the ON clause, it can make your code easier to read and maintain. As a result, it often makes sense to use the USING clause when you're developing new statements. However, if you can't get the USING clause to work correctly because of the way your database is structured, you can always use the ON clause instead.

### Description
- You can use the USING keyword to simplify the syntax for joining tables. 
- The join can be an inner join or an outer join. 
- The tables must be joined by a column that bas the same name in both tables. 
- To include multiple columns, separate them with commas. 
- The join must be an equijoin, which means that the equals operator is used to compare the two columns.

## How to join tables with NATURAL keyword
- Figure 4-11 shows how to use the NATURAL keyword to code a natural join. When you code a natural join, you don' t specify the column that's used to join the two tables. Instead, the database automatically joins the two tables based on all columns in the two tables that have the same name. As a result, this type of join only works correctly if the database is designed in a certain way.
- For instance, if you use a natural join to join the Vendors and Invoices tables as shown in the first example, the join works correctly because these tables only have one column in common: the vendor_id column. As a result, the database joins these two tables on the vendor_id column. However, if these tables had another column in common, this query would attempt to join these tables on both columns and would yield unexpected results. 
- In addition, you may get unexpected results if you use natural joins for complex queries. In that case, you can use the USING or ON clause to explicitly specify the join since these clauses give you more control over the join. If necessary, you can mix a natural join with the USING or ON clause within a single SELECT statement. In this figure , for example, the second SELECT statement uses a natural join for the first join and a USING clat1se for the second join. The result is the same as the result for the second statement in figure 4-10. 
- Finally, since natural joins don't explicitly specify the join column, they may not work correctly if the structure of the database changes later. So although natural joins are easy to code, you'll usually want to avoid using them for production code.

### Description
- You can use the NATURAL keyword to create a natural join that joins two tables based on all columns in the two tables that have the same name. 
- Although the code for a nat1rral join is shorter than the code for joins that use the ON or USING clause, a natural join only works correctly for ce1tain types of database structures. In addition, a natural join often yields unexpected results for complex queries. As a rest1lt, it's more common to t1se the ON or USING clause to join tables.

## How to use cross joins
- A cross join produces a result set that includes each row from the first table joined with each row fro1n the second table. The result set is known as the Cartesian product of the tables. Figure 4-12 shows how to code a cross join using either the explicit or implicit syntax. 
- To use the explicit syntax, you include the CROSS JOIN keywords between the two tables in the FROM clause. Because of the way a cross join works, you don't code an ON clause that includes a join condition. The same is true when you use the implicit syntax. In that case, you simply list the tables in the FROM clause and omit the join condition from the WHERE clause. 
- The two SELECT statements in this figure illustrate how cross joins work. Both of these statements combine data from the Departments and Employees tables. For both statements, the result is a table that includes 45 rows. That's each of the five rows in the Departments table combined with each of the nine rows in the Employees table. Although this result set is relatively small, you can imagine how large it would be if the tables included hundreds or thousands of rows. 
- As you study these examples, you should realize that cross joins have few practical uses. As a result, you'll rarely, if ever, need to use one. In fact, you're most likely to code a cross join by accident if you use the implicit join syntax and forget to code the join condition in the WHERE clause. That's one of the reasons why it's generally considered a good practice to use the explicit join syntax.

- A cross join joins each row from the first table with each row from the second table. The resuJt set returned by a cross join is known as a Cartesian product.
