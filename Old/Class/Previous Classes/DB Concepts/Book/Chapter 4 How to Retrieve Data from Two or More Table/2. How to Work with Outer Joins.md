# How to Work with Outer Joins
Although inner joins are the most common type of join, MySQL also supports outer joins. Unlike an inner join, an outer join returns all of the rows from one of the tables involved in the join, regardless of whether the join condition is true.
## How to code an outer join
- Figure 4-8 presents the explicit syntax for coding an outer join. Because this syntax is similar to the explicit syntax for inner joins, you shouldn't have any trouble understanding how it works. The main difference is that you include the LEFT or RIGHT keyword to specify the type of outer join you want to perform. You can also include the OUTER keyword, but it's optional and is usually omitted. 
- When you use a left outer join, the result set includes all the rows from the first, or left, table. Similarly, when you use a right outer join, the result set includes all the rows from the second, or right, table. 
- The example in this figure illustrates a left outer join. Here, the Vendors table is joined with the Invoices table. In addition, the result set includes vendor rows even if no matching invoices are found. In that case, null values are returned for the columns in the Invoices table.

### Description
- An outer join 1Â·etrieves all rows that satisfy the join condition, plus unmatched rows in the left or right table. 
- In most cases, you use the equal operator to retrieve rows with matching columns. However, you can also use any of the other comparison operators. 
- When a row with unmatched columns is retrieved, any columns from the other table that are included in the result set are given null values.
### Note
- The OUTER keyword is optional and typically omitted

## Outer join examples
- To give yot1 a better understanding of how outer joins work, figure 4-9 shows four more examples. To start, part 1 of this figure shows the Departments table, the Employees table, and the Projects table from the EX database. These tables are used by the examples shown in parts 2 and 3 of this figure. In addition, they're used in other examples later in this chapter. 
- The first example performs a left outer join on the Departments and Employees tables. Here, the join condition joins the tables based on the values in their department_number columns. Then, the result set produced by this statement, shows that department number 3 (Operations) is included in the result set even though none of the employees in the Employees table work in that department. As a result, MySQL assigns a null value to the last_name column from that table. 
- The second example uses a right outer join to join the Departments and Employees table. In this case, all of the rows from the Employees table are included in the result set. However, two of the employees, Locario and Watson, are assigned to a department that doesn't exist in the Departments table. If the department_number column in the Employees table had been defined as a foreign key to the Departments table, this would not have been allowed by MySQL. In this case, though, a foreign key wasn't defiled, so null values are returned for the department_name column in these two rows. 
- When coding outer joins, it's a common practice to avoid using right joins. To do that, you can substitute a left outer join for a right outer join by reversing the order of the tables in the FROM clause and using the LEFT keyword instead of RIGHT. This often makes it easier to read statements that join more than two tables. The third example shows that you can use outer joins to work with more than two tables. To do that, you use skills similar to those that you use to work with inner joins with more than two tables. In this example, the statement uses left outer joins to join all three tables: Departments, Employees, and Projects. Because of this, the result set uses a null value to show that none of the employees are assigned to the Operations department. In addition, the result set uses null values to show that two employees, Hardy and Jones, aren't assigned to a project. 
- The fourth example shows that you can combine inner joins and outer joins in the same query. Here, the query works like the third example, but it uses an inner join for the first join instead of a left outer join. Because of this, the result set doesn't include a row for the Operations department. However, it still displays the rows for the two employees, Hardy and Jones, that aren't assigned to a project.

### Description
- The examples in this figure use the Departments, Employees, and Projects tables from the EX database.

### Description
- A left outer join returns unmatched rows from the first (left) table. 
- A right outer join returns unmatched rows from the second (right) table.

### Description
- You can use outer joins to join multiple tables. 
- You can combine inner and outer joins within a single SELECT statement.
