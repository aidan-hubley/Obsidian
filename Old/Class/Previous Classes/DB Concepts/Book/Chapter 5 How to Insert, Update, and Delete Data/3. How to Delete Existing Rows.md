# How to Delete Existing Rows
To delete one or more rows from a table, you use the DELETE statement. If necessary, you can use subqueries in a DELETE statement to help identify the rows to be deleted.
## How to delete rows
- Figure 5-7 presents the syntax of the DELETE statement along with four examples that show how it works. To start, the DELETE clause specifies the name of the table and must include the FROM keyword. 
- The WHERE clause specifies a search condition that identifies the rows to be deleted. Although this clause is optional, you'll almost always include it. If you don't, you could inadvertently delete all of the rows in the table. Fortunately, MySQL Workbench runs in safe t1pdate mode by default, which prevents a DELETE statement from executing if it doesn't include a WHERE clause that refers to a primary key or foreign key column. 
- If you want to make sure that you've selected the correct rows before you delete them, you can code a SELECT statement that retrieves those rows. Then, once you're sure the SELECT statement is retrieving the correct rows, you can convert the SELECT statement to a DELETE statement. 
- The first DELETE statement in this figure deletes a single row from the General_Ledger_Accounts table. To do that, it specifies the account_number value of the row to be deleted in the WHERE clause. The second DELETE statement deletes a single row from the Invoice_Line_ltems table. To do that, it specifies the invoice_id value and the invoice_sequence value of the row to be deleted in the WHERE clause. Finally, the third DELETE statement deletes four rows from the Invoice_Line_Items table. To do that, it specifies 12 as the invoice id value of the row to be deleted. Since the invoice for this ID has four line items, this deletes all four line items. 
- If you try to delete a row that has one or more related rows in another table, MySQL typically returns an error message and doesn't delete the row. For example, MySQL returns an error message if you attempt to delete a row from the Vendors table that has related rows in the Invoices table. Usually, that's what you want.
## How to use a subquery in a DELETE statement
- If you want to delete a row from the Vendors table that has related rows in the Invoices table, you need to start by deleting the rows in the Invoice_Line_Items table for the vendor's invoices. To do that, you can use a subquery as shown in the fourth example in figure 5-7. Here, the subquery selects all the invoice IDs for the vendor from the Invoices table. Then, the DELETE statement deletes all the invoice line items with those IDs.
### The syntax of the DELETE statement
- DELETE FROM table_name
- [WHERE search_condition]

### Use a subquery in a DELETE statement

### Description
- You can use the DELETE statement to delete one or more rows from the table you name in the DELETE clause. 
- You specify the conditions that must be met for a row to be deleted in the WHERE clause. 
- You can use a subquery within the WHERE clause. 
- A foreign key constraint may prevent you from deleting a row. In that case, you can only delete the row if you delete all child rows for that row first. 
- By default, MySQL Workbench runs in safe update mode. That prevents you from deleting rows if the WHERE clause is omitted or doesn't refer to a primary key or foreign key column. For information on turning safe update mode off, see figure 5-5.
### Warning
- If you tum safe update mode off and omit the WHERE clause from a DELETE statement, all the rows in the table will be deleted.
