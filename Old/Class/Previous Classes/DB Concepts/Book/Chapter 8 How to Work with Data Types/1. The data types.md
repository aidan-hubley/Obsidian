# The data types
- A column's data type specifies the kind of information the column is intended to store. In addition, a column's data type determines the operations that can be performed on the column.
## Overview
- The MySQL data types can be divided into the five categories shown in figure 8-1. To start, the character data types are intended for storing a string of one or more characters, which can include letters, numbers, symbols, or special characters. The terms character, string, and text are used interchangeably to describe this type of data.
- The numeric data types are intended for storing numbers that can be used for mathematical calculations. As you'll see in this chapter, MySQL can store numbers in a variety of formats. At a basic level, you can divide numbers into two categories: integers and real numbers. Integers are numbers that don't have a decimal point, and real numbers are numbers that have a decimal point. 
- The date and time data types are intended for storing dates, times, or both dates and times. These data types are typically referred to as date/time or temporal data types. 
- Since the first three categories are the most widely used, this book focuses on these data types. However, MySQL also provides large object (LOB) data types that are useful for storing images, sound, video, and large amounts of character data. In addition, MySQL provides spatial data types that are useful for storing geographical values such as global positioning system (GPS) data. These data types are referred to as geometry types because they define a point or group of points that represent any location or area in the world. 
- Finally, MySQL provides the ISON data type, which is used to store JavaScript Object Notation (ISON) documents. Although you can store JSON documents in a character column, the JSON data type provides two advantages. First, when you store a JSON document in a JSON column, the document is automatically validated. Then, if it's invalid, an error occurs. Second, the internal storage format provides for quick access to the document.
### Data types
|Category|Description|
|-|-|
|Character|Strings of character data
|Numeric|Numbers that don't include a decimal point (integers) and numbers that include a decimal point (real numbers)
|Date and Time|Dates, times, or both
|Large Objects (LOB)|Large strings of characters or binary data
|Spatial|Geographical values
|JSON|JSON documents
### Description
- MySQL provides data types for storing many types of data. 
- Numbers that don't include a decimal point are known as integers.
- Numbers that include a decimal point are known as real numbers. 
- The date and time data. types are often referred to as the date/time or temporal data type.
- The large object (LOB) data types are ·useful for storing images, sound, video, and large amounts of text. 
- The spatial data types are useful for storing geometric or geographical values such as global positioning system (GPS) data. These data types are referred to as geometry types. 
- The ISON data type is used for storing JavaScript Object Notation (ISON) documents.

## The character types
- Figure 8-2 presents the two most common character data types supported by MySQL: CHAR and VARCHAR. These data types store strings of characters. 
- You use the CHAR type to store fixed-length strings. Data stored using this data type always occupies the same number of bytes regardless of the actual length of the string. This data type is typically used to define columns that have a fixed number of characters. For example, the vendor_state column in the Vendors table is defined as CHAR(2) because it always contains two characters. However, if two chruacters are stored in a CHAR(lO) column, MySQL appends eight spaces to the string so it contains 10 characters. 
- You use the VARCHAR data type to store variable-length strings. Data stored using this data type occupies only the number of bytes needed to store the string plus an extra byte to store the length of the string. This data type is typically used to define colt1mns whose lengths vary from one row to the next. For example, the vendor_name column in the Vendors table is defined as VARCHAR(50) because the length of each vendor's name varies. 
- With MySQL 8.0 and later, the CHAR and VARCHAR types use the uif81nb4 character set by default. This character set uses up to four bytes to store each character. As a 1·esult, it's referred to as a multiple-byte character set. This allows the utf8mb4 character set to support the characters specified by the Unicode standard, which includes most characters from most of the world's languages. To do that, this character set uses 1 byte for characters that are used in English and by most western European languages. It uses 2 bytes for most European and Middle Eastern script letters. And it uses 3 bytes for Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs. To store emojis and other icons, it uses 4 bytes. 
- When you use the utf8mb4 character set with a CHAR type, MySQL must reserve four bytes for each character. As a result, MySQL must t1se 8 bytes for the CHAR(2) type, and it must use 40 bytes for the CHAR(l 0) type. However, when you use the VARCHAR type, MySQL doesn't need to reserve space for each character. As a result, if you are using English letters and symbols, MySQL only uses one byte per character, plus one byte to store the length of the string. For example, when you store a string of 'CA', MySQL only uses 3 bytes. This shows that you can typically save storage space by using the VARCHAR type. 
- With MySQL 5.6 and 5.7, the CHAR and VARCHAR types used the uif8,nb3 character set. This character set is similar to the utf8mb4 character set, but it can only use up to 3 bytes to store each character. Because of that, it's not able to store the emojis that are becoming so prevalent. Note that this character set is deprecated in MySQL 8.0 and will be removed in a future release. 
- With MySQL 5.5 and earlier, the CHAR and VARCHAR types used the latin character set by default. This character set uses one byte to store each character. As a result, it's referred to as a single-byte character set. This character set supports all of the characters that are used in English and by most western European languages. However, it doesn't support other characters such as Middle Eastern script letters and Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs.
### The character types
|Type|Bytes|Description|
|-|-|-|
|CHAR (M)|Mx4|Fixed-length strings of character data where M is the number of characters, between O and 255. With the utf8mb4 character set, MySQL must reserve four bytes for each character in a CHAR column because that's the maximum possible length.
|VARCHAR (M)|L+1| Variable-lengtl1 strings of character data where M is the 1naximum number of characters, between O and 255. For English and Latin characters, the number of bytes used to store the string is equaJ to length of the string (L) plus 1 byte to record its length.
### How the character types work with utf8mb4
|Data type|Orginal value|Value stored|Bytes used|
|-|-|-|-|
|CHAR (2)|'CA'|'CA'|8
|CHAR(10)|'CA'|'CA        '|40
|VARCHAR(10)|'CA'|'CA'|3
|VARCHAR(20)|'California'|'California'|11
|VARCHAR(20)|'New York'|'New York'|9
|VARCHAR(20)|'Murach's MySQL'|"Murach's MySQL"|15
### How the uftmb4 character set works
- Basic Latin letters, digits, and punctuation signs use one byte. 
- Most European and Middle East script letters use 2 bytes. 
- Korean, Chinese, and Japanese ideographs use 3 bytes. 
- Emojis and other icons use 4 bytes.
### Description
- The CHAR type is used for fixed-length strings. A column with this type uses the same amount of storage for each value regardless of the actual length of the string. 
- The VARCHAR type is used for variable-length strings. A column with this type uses a varying amount of storage for each value depending on the length of the string. 
- By default, MySQL 8.0 and later use the utj8mb4 character set for the CHAR and VAR CHAR types. This character set is a multiple-byte character set. It typically uses 1 byte per character, but can use up to 4 bytes per character. However, the utf8mb4 format provides for all characters in most languages by providing support for all of the characters in the Unicode standard. 
- By default, MySQL 5.6 and 5.7 use the utj8mb3 character set for the CHAR and VAR CHAR types, which can use up to 3 bytes per character. 
- By default, MySQL 5.5 and earlier use the latin1 character set for the CHAR and VARCHAR types. This character set is a single-byte character set that supports all of the characters that are used in English and by most western European languages. 
- To learn how to change the character set, please see chapter 11.

- In most cases, it makes sense to use the utf8mb4 character set. That way, your database supports most characters in most languages as well as emojis. However, if you want to use the CHAR type and you only need to support English and western European languages, you may want to use the latin1 character set to keep storage requirements to a minimum. In chapter 11, you'll learn how to change the character set for a database. 
- Although you typically store numeric values using numeric types, the character types may be a better choice for some numeric values. For example, you typically store zip codes, telephone numbers, and social security numbers in character columns even if they contain only numbers. That's because their values aren't used in numeric operations. In addition, if you store these numbers in numeric columns, MySQL may strip leading zeros in some situations, which isn't what you want. 
- In figure 8-2, the first five examples use single quotes to specify a string literal. However, the sixth example uses double quotes to specify a string literal. This allows the string literal to include a single quote, and it shows that you can use single or double quotes for string literals. Although it's common to use single quotes, double quotes are useful if you need to include a single quote in the string.

## The integer types
- Figure 8-3 shows the integer types, which are numbers that don't include a decim.al point. The integer data types differ in the amount of storage they use and the range of values they can store. Since the INT type can store a wide range of numbers and only requires 4 bytes of storage, it's the most commonly used of the integer types. 
- By default, the integer types can store positive and negative numbers. However, you can include the UNSIGNED attribute for an integer type to prevent negative values from being stored in the column. In that case, the range of acceptable positive values for the column is doubled. 
- If the ZEROFILL attribute for the integer is set, the UNSIGNED attribute is automatically set, and the integer is displayed with zeros padded from the left, up to the maximt1m display size. For the INT type, for instance, the maximum display size is 10 digits. If the default display size is too wide, you can specify a smaller display size by coding it in parentheses after the data type. In this figure, for instance, the last example specifies a display size of 4 digits. This only affects how MySQL displays the value, not how it stores the value. 
- The INTEGER type is a synonym for the INT type. As a result, you can use these types interchangeably. However, it's a common programming practice to use INT as an abbreviation for INTEGER. 
- The BOOL and BOOLEAN types are synonyms for TINYINT(l). When you work with these types, you can use a value of O to store false values and a value of 1 to store true values. To make that more intuitive, you can use the FALSE keyword, which is an alias for 0, and the TRUE keyword, which is an alias for 1.
### The integer types 
|Types|Bytes|Value ranges|
|-|-|-|
|BIGIT|8|Signed: -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807 Unsigned: 0 to L8,446,744,073,709,551,615
|INT|4|Signed: -2,147,483,648 to 2, 147,483,647 Unsigned: 0 to 4,294,967,295
|MEDIUMINT|3|Signed: -8,388,608 5to 8,388,607 Unsigned: 0 and 16,777,215
|SMALLINT|2|Signed: -8,388,608 5to 8,388,607 Unsigned: 0 and 16,777,215
|TINYINT|1|Signed: -128 and 127 Unsigned: 0 and 255
### How the UNSIGNED and ZEROFILL attributes work
|Data type|Original value|Value stored|Value displayed|
|-|-|-|-|
|INT|99|99|99
|INT|-99|-99|-99
|INT UNSIGNED|99|99|99
|INT UNSIGNED|-99|None|None
|INT ZEROFILL|99|99|0000000099
|INT(4) ZEROFILL|99|99|0099
### Description
- The integer types store numbers without any digits to the right of the decimal point. • If the UNSIGNED attribute for the integer is set, it changes the range of acceptable values. If you try to store a negative integer in a column with the UNSIGNED attribute, an error occurs.
- If the ZEROFILL attribute for the integer is set, MySQL displays the integer with zeros padded from the left, up to the maximum display size. 
- If the ZEROFILL attribute is set, MySQL automatically sets the UNSIGNED attribute. 
- To specify a display size, you can code it in _parentheses after the data type. This only affects how MySQL displays the value, not how it stores the value. 
- The INTEGER type is a synonym for the INT type. 
- The BOOL and BOOLEAN types are synonyms for TINYINT(l). You can use these types to store TRUE and FALSE values, where 1 represents a true value and 0 represents a false value.

## The fixed-point and floating-point types
- Figure 8-4 presents the data types for storing real numbers, which are numbers that have digits to the right of the decimal point. To start, you can use the DECIMAL type to store fixed-point numbers, which are numbers that have a fixed number of digits to the right of the decimal point.
- The number of digits a value has to the tight of the decimal point is called its scale, and the total number of digits is called its precision. You can customize the precision and scale of the DECIMAL type so they're right for the data to be stored. For instance, if you need to store monetary values, it's common to use two digits to the right of the decimal place as shown in the first three examples. 
- When you use the DECIMAL type, MySQL uses a varying number of bytes to store the value. In general, it packs 9 digits into 4 bytes. However, it stores the digits to the left and right of the decimal point separately, and it can use fewer than 4 bytes if there are fewer than 9 digits. As a result, DECIMAL(9, 2) requires 5 bytes, while DECIMAL(18, 9) requires 8 bytes. For more details about how this works, you can check the MySQL Reference Manual.
- In contrast to the DECIMAL type, the DOUBLE and FLOAT types store floating-point numbers. These data types provide for very large and very small numbers, but with a limited number of significant digits. The FLOAT type can be used to store a single-precision number, which provides for numbers with up to 7 significant digits. And the DOUBLE type can be used to store a double-precision number, which provides for numbers with up to 15 significant digits. 
- To express the value of a floating-point number, you can use scientific ,iotation. To use this notation, you type the letter E followed by a power of 10. For instance, 3.65E+9 is equal to 3.65 x 109, or 3,650,000,000. Conversely, 3.65E-9 is equal to 3.65 x 10· 9, or 0.00000000365. If you have a mathematical background, of course, you 're already familiar with this notation. 
- Because the precision of the integer types and the DECIMAL type is exact, these data types are considered exact numeric types. In contrast, the DOUBLE and FLOAT types are considered approximate numeric types because they may not represent a value exactly. That can happen, for example, when a number is rounded to the appropriate number of significant digits. In this figure, for instance, the last example shows that the FLOAT type rounds the original value and only stores 7 significant digits. For business applications, you typically use the exact numeric types, as there's seldom the need to work with the very large and very small numbers that the floating-point data types are designed for. However, for scientific applications, you may sometimes need to use the DOUBLE and FLOAT types. 
- The DECIMAL, DOUBLE, and FLOAT types have numerous synonyms. Sometimes these synonyms are helpful because they make it easier to work with data from other databases. However, when working with a MySQL database, most programmers use the DECIMAL, DOUBLE, and FLOAT types. 
- When you work with real numbers, you can use the UNSIGNED and ZEROFILL attributes. These attributes work similarly to the way they do with integer types.
### The fixed-point type
|Type|Bytes|Description|
|-|-|-|
|DECIMAL(M, D)|Vary|Fixed-precision numbers where M specifies the maximum number of total digits (the precision) and D specifies the nu1nber of digits to the rigbl of the decimal (the scale). M can range from l to 65. D can range from Oto 30 but can't be larger than M. The default is 0.
### The floating-point types
|Type|Bytes|Description|
|-|-|-|
|DOUBLE|8|Double-precisio11 floating-point numbers from - l.7976xl0308 to l .7976xl 03°8.
|FLOAT|4|Single-precision floating-point numbers from -3.4028xl 038 to 3.4028xl038.
### How the fixed-point (exact) and floating-point (approximate) types work
|Data type|Original value|Value stored|Bytes used|
|-|-|-|-|
|DECIMAL(9, 2)|1.2|1.20|5
|DECIMAL(9, 2)|1234567.98|1234567.89|5
|DECIMAL(9, 2)|-1234567.98|-1234567.89|5
|DECIMAL(18, 9)|1234567.89|1234567.890000000|8
|DOUBLE|1234567.89|1234567.89|8
|FLOAT|1234567.89|12345670|4
### Description
- Real numbers can include digits to the right of the decimal point. The precision of a real number indicates the total number of digits that can be stored, and the scale indicates the number of digits that can be stored to the right of the decimal point. 
- The DECIMAL type is considered an exact numeric type because its precision is exact.
- The DOUBLE and FLOAT types store floating-point numbers, which have a limited number of significant digits. These data types are considered approximate numeric data types because they may not represent a value exactly. 
- If the UNSIGNED attribute for a real number is set, it prevents storing negative values in the column but does not affect the range of acceptable values. 
- If the ZEROFILL attribute for a real number is set, the number is displayed with zeros padded from the left, and the UNSIGNED attribute is automatically set. 
- The DEC, NUMERIC, and FIXED types are synonyms for the DECIMAL type. 
- The REAL and DOUBLE PRECISION types are synonyms for the DOUBLE type.

## The date and time types
- Part 1 of figure 8-5 presents the five date and time types supported by MySQL. You can use the DATE type to store a date without a time. You can use the TIME type to store a time without a date. And you can use either the DATETIME or TIMESTAMP types to store both a date and a time. 
- You typically use the TIMESTAMP type to keep track of when a row was inserted or last updated. For example, you might use this type to keep track of the entries on a blog. MySQL makes that easy by automatically setting the TIMESTAMP column to the current date and time whenever a row is inserted or updated. If that's not what you want, you can use the DATETIME type instead. 
- The problem with the TIMESTAMP type is that it can only store dates up to the year 2038. This is known as the yea,-2038 problem, the Y2K38 problem, and the Unix Millennium bug. As a result, if you want your database to be able to store dates that go beyond 2038, you should use the DATETIME type instead of the TIMESTAMP type. Otherwise, you can use the TIMESTAMP type since it only requires 4 bytes to store a TIMESTAMP value, compared to 8 bytes for a DATETIME value.
- If you need to store a year without any other temporal data, you can use the YEAR type. With MySQL 5.7.5 and later, the YEAR type stores 4-digit years from 1901 to 2155. Entries with one and two digits are still acceptable, though, and are converted to 4-digit years as indicated in this figure. Note that, by default, a numeric literal of O or 00 is converted to 0000. To store the value 2000 in a YEAR column, you must code it as a string. 
- Prior to MySQL 5.7.5, the YEAR column could also store a 2-digit year. To define a column like this, you coded the YEAR(2) type. Then, 2-digit entries were stored as entered and 1-digit entries were converted to two digits.
### The date and time types
|Type|Bytes|Description|
|-|-|-|
|Date|3|Dates from January 1, 1000 through December 3 1, 9999. The default format for display and e.ntry is "yyyy-m1n-dd" .
|Time|3|Times in the range -838:59:59 through 838:59:59. The default format for display and entry is "hh:1nm:ss".
|Datetime|8|Combination date and time from midnight January l , 1970 to December 31, 9999. The default format for display and entry is "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss".
|Timestamp|4|Combination date and time from midnight January 1, 1970 to the year 2037. The default format is "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss".
|Year[(4)]|1|Years in 4-digit format. Allowable values are from 1901 to 2155.
### Description
- A column of TIMESTAMP type is auton1atically updated to the current date and time when a row is inserted or updated. If a table bas multiple TIMESTAMP columns, only the first one is updated automatically. 
- The TIMESTAMP type can only store dates up to the year 2038. This is known as the year 2038 problem, the Y2K38 problem, and the Unix Millennium bug. To fix this problem, use the DATETIME type instead of the TIMESTAMP type and update the value manually as needed. 
- MySQL 5.7 .5 and later support only 4-digit years, which can be defined as YEAR and YEAR( 4). I-digit and 2-digit years can still be entered but are converted to 4-digit years. Values from Oto 69 are converted to 2000 to 2069, and values from 70 to 99 are converted to 1970 to 1999. 
- For a value of O or 00 to be stored as 2000 in a YEAR column, you 1nust enter it as a string. Otherwise, it's stored as 0000.

- When you work with the date and time types, you need to know how to code date and time literals. Part 2 of figure 8-5 shows how to do that. The default date fo1mat for MySQL is ''yyyy-mm-dd'', which is why we've used this forn1at in most of the examples in this book. By default, MySQL doesn't support other common date formats such as ''m.m/dd/yy''. If you attempt to use an unsupported format, MySQL returns an error. 
- You also need to be aware of the two-digit year cutoff that's defined on your system. When you code a two-digit year, the two-digit year cutoff determines bow MySQL interprets the year. By default, MySQL interprets the years 00 through 69 as 2000 through 2069, and it interprets the years 70 through 99 as 1970 through 1999. Usually, that's what you want. However, the two-digit year cutoff can be modified if necessary. In general, it's considered a good coding practice to use four-digit years. That way, you can be sure that MySQL is interpreting the year correctly. 
- MySQL interprets any punctuation character in a literal as a delimiter between date parts or time parts. If you don't use any delimiters, you can code the value as a numeric literal. In that case, you don't need to use single quotes. 
- When storing a date in a DATE column, the values are loosely checked for valid data. For instance, months must be in the range 0-12 and days must be in the range 0-31. For illegal dates, such as February 31, MySQL returns an error. However, MySQL allows you to store unconventional date values, such as ''2018-12-00'', which represents a month and year without a specific day. 
- The default time format for MySQL is ''hh:mm:ss'', using a 24-hour clock. Many of the same rules for coding date literals also apply to time literals. For instance, you can use any punctuation character as a delimiter. Similarly, for valid values, you can omit the delimiters. In that case, you can use a numeric literal (no quotes) instead of a string literal (quotes). Finally, MySQL checks times for validity. For illegal times, such as ''19:61:11'', MySQL returns an error. 
- The default date/time format for MySQL is a combination of the date and time formats. Most of the rules for coding date/time literals rue a combination of the rules for coding date and time literals. In addition, if you don't specify a time when storing a TIMESTAMP or DATETIME value, the time defaults to 00:00:00, which is midnight.
### How MySQL interprets literal date/time values
|Literal value|Value stored in DATE column|
|-|-|
|'2018-08-15'|2018-08-15 
|'2018-8-15' |2018-08-15 
|'18-8-15' |2018-08-15 
|'20180815' |2018-08-15 
|20180815 |2018-08-15 
|'2018 . 08.15' |2018-08-15 
|'18/8/15'|2018-08-15 
|8/15/18 |None 
|'2018-02-31'| None

|Literal value|Value stored in TIME column|
|-|-|
|'7:32'|07:32:00
|'19:32:11'|19:32:11
|'193211'|19:32:11
|193211|19:32:11
|'19:61:11'| None

|Literal value|Value stored in DATETIME or TIMESTAMP column|
|-|-|
|'2018-08-15 19:32:11'|2018-08-15 19:32:11
|'2018-08-15'|2018-08-15 00:00:00

### Description
- You can specify date and time values by coding a literal value. In most cases, you enclose the literal value in single quotes. 
- For dates, MySQL uses the ''yyyy-mm-dd'' format. For times, MySQL uses the ''hh:mm:ss'' format, using a 24-hour clock. 
- By default, MySQL does not support common date formats used by other systems such as ''mm/dd/yy'' and ''mon/dd/yyyy''. 
- By default, MySQL interprets 2-digit years from 00 to 69 as 2000 to 2069 and the years from 70 to 99 as 1970 to 1999. 
- MySQL interprets any punctuation character as a delimiter between date parts. If you don't use any delimiters, you can code the value as a numeric literal without quotes.
- If you don't specify a time when sorting a DATETIME or TIMESTAMP value, MySQL stores a time value of 00:00:00 (12:00 midnight). 
- If you don't specify seconds when storing a TIME value, MySQL stores 00 for the seconds. • When storing date and time values, MySQL loosely checks the values to make sure they are valid. For example, months must be in the range 0-12, days must be in the range 0-31, and so on. If MySQL determines that a date or time isn't valid, it returns an error. 
- MySQL 5.5 and later are stricter than previous versions of MySQL for storing date and time values. If MySQL can't interpret a value, it returns an error or a warning.

## The ENUM and SET types
- The ENUM and SET types can be considered character data types since they allow you to restrict the values for a column to a limited set of strings as shown in figure 8-6. However, MySQL internally stores these values as integers, which reduces the nun1ber of bytes needed to store each string. 
- The main difference between the ENUM and SET types is that an ENUM column can store exactly one value, but a SET column can store zero, one, or up to 64 different values. In other words, an ENUM column can consist of only one member in a set of values, while the SET column may consist of any, or all, members in a set. 
- You can use the ENUM type to store values that are mutually exclusive, such as Yes, No, or Maybe. In other words, you can use the ENUM type to represent a choice of one value, but not two. For example, delivery or pickup; cash, credit, or debit; small, medium, or large; paper or plastic; soup or salad, although I suppose you might want both soup and salad. For that, you could use a SET column. 
- You can use a SET column when you want to choose more than one value. For example, the toppings on a pizza, the software on a computer, or the features of a car could be SET values. 
- The acceptable values for an ENUM or SET column are defined when the table is created. An ENUM column can specify up to 65,535 acceptable values. However, a SET column is limited to 64 values. 
- To store a value in an ENUM column, you code a single text string. If the string is one of the acceptable values for the column, MySQL stores that value. Otherwise, MySQL assigns an empty string to the column. 
- When you add a row to a table that contains an ENUM column, MySQL assigns a default value to that column if you don't explicitly specify a value. If the column allows null values, MySQL assigns a null value to the col11mn. If the column doesn't allow null values, MySQL assigns the first value in the set of acceptable values. If you want MySQL to use a specific value as the default value, then, you'll want to code that value as the first value in the set. 
- To store values in a SET column, you code a single string with one or more values separated by commas. Then, MySQL stores each acceptable value and ignores any other values. Since commas are used to separate values, you can't use commas within a value when you define the SET column. 
- When storing multiple values in a SET column, the order of the values doesn't matter. That's because MySQL stores the values in the same order as in the column definition. It also doesn't matter if you repeat a value because MySQL doesn't store duplicate values.
### The ENUM and SET types
|Type|Bytes|Description|
|-|-|-|
|ENUM|1-2|Stores one value selected from a list of accepted values
|SET|1-8|Stores zero or more values from a list of accepted values

### How values are stored in ENUM columns
|Value|Stored in column ENUM ('Yes', 'No', 'Maybe')|
|-|-|
|'Yes'|'Yes'
|'No'|'No'
|'Maybe'|'Maybe'
|'Possibly'|' '

### How values are stored in SET columns
|Value|Stored in column SET ('Pepperoni', 'Mushrooms', 'Olives')|
|-|-|
|'Pepperoni'|'Pepperoni'
|'Mushrooms'|'Mushrooms'
|'Pepperoni, Bacon'|'Pepperoni'
|'Olives, Pepperoni'|'Pepperoni, Olives'

### Description
- The ENUM and SET types can be used to restrict the values that you store to a limited set of values. The ENUM column can take on exactly one value, but a SET column can take on zero, one, or up to 64 different values. 
- You can define the set of acceptable values for an ENUM or SET column when you create a table. An ENUM column can have up to 65,535 acceptable values, but a SET column is limited to 64 acceptable values. 
- To specify a value for· an ENUM column, you code a single text string. If the string contains an acceptable value, that value is stored in the column. Otherwise, the column is assigned an empty string. 
- If you don't specify a value for an ENUM column when you insert a row, MySQL assigns a default value that depends on whether the column allows null values. If the column allows null values, MySQL assigns a null value to the column. If it doesn't allow null values, MySQL assigns the first value in the set of acceptable values to the column. 
- To specify values for a SET column, you code a single string with the values separated by commas. Each acceptable value is stored in the column, and any other values are ignored. 
- When you store values in a SET column, MySQL stores the values using the order specified in the column definition, and it does not store duplicate values.

## The large object types
- Figure 8-7 presents the large object (LOB) types. These data types are designed to store large amounts of binary or character data. 
- The BLOB (binary large object) types store strings of binary data. This data type is often used to store images, sounds, and video. However, the BLOB types can be used to store any type of binary data, including the binary data that's normally stored in application files such as PDF files or Word files. 
- The TEXT types work similarly to the BLOB types, but they store strings of characters. As a result, in other database systems, they are sometimes referred to as character large object (CLOE) types. These data types can be used to store large amounts of character data including data that's normally stored in text, XML, or JSON files. 
- To read and write data from a column defined with a BLOB or TEXT type, you typically use another programming language such as Java or PHP. As a result, we don't cover these types in this book. However, if you want to use these types, you can learn more about
