# An Introduction to the SELECT Statement
## The Basic Syntax of the SELECT Statement
- Figure 3-1 presents the basic syntax of the SELECT statement. The syntax summary at the top of this figure uses conventions that are similar to those used in other programming manuals. Capitalized words are keywords that you have to type exactly as shown. In contrast you have to provide replacements for the lowercase words. For example, you can enter a list of columns in place of select_list, and you can enter a table name in place of table_source. 
- Beyond that, you can omit the clauses enclosed in brackets ( [] ). If you compare the syntax in this figure with the coding examples in the next figure, you should easily see how the two are related. 
- This syntax summary has been simplified so you can focus on the five main clauses of the SELECT statement: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT. Most SELECT statements contain the first four of these clauses. However, only the SELECT clause is required. 
- The SELECT clause is al ways the first clause in a SELECT statement. It identifies the columns in the result set. These columns are retrieved from the base tables named in the FROM clause. Since this chapter focuses on retrieving data from a single table, the examples in this chapter use FROM clauses that name a single base table. In the next chapter, though, you'll learn how to retrieve data from two or more tables. The WHERE, ORDER BY, and LIMIT clauses rue optional. The ORDER BY clause determines how the rows in the result set are sorted, and the WHERE clause determines which rows in the base table are included in the result set. 
- The WHERE clause specifies a search condition that's used to filter the rows in the base table. When this condition is true, the row is included in the result set. 
- The LIMIT clause limits the number of rows in the result set. In contrast to the WHERE clause, which uses a search condition, the LIMIT clause simply returns a specified number of rows, regardless of the size of the full result set. Of course, if the result set has fewer rows than are specified by the LIMIT clause, all the rows in the result set are returned.

FROM table_source
WHERE search_condition
ORDER BY order_by_list
LIMIT row_limit

### The five clauses of the SELECT Statement
|Clause|Description|
|-|-|
|SELECT|Describes the columns in the result set
|FROM|Names the base table from which the query retrieves the data
|WHERE|Specifies the conditions that must be met for a row to be included in the result set
|ORDER BY|Specifies how to sort the rows in the result set
|LIMIT|Specifies the number of rows to return

### Description
- You use the basic SELECT statement shown above to retrieve the columns specified in the SELECT clause from the base table specified in the FROM clause and store them in a result set. 
- The WHERE clause is used to filter the rows in the base table so that only those rows that match the search condition are included in the result set. If you omit the WHERE clause, all of the rows in the base table are included. 
- The search condition of a WHERE clause consists of one or more Boolean expressions that result in a true, false, or null value. If the combination of all the expressions is a t1ue value, the row being tested is included in the result set. Otherwise, it's not. 
- If you include the ORDER BY clause, the rows in the result set are sorted in the specified sequence. Otherwise, the sequence of the rows is not guaranteed by MySQL. 
- If you include the LIMIT clause, the result set that's retrieved is limited to a specified number of 1·ows. If you omit this clause, all rows that match are returned. 
- You must code the clauses in the 01·der shown or you'll get a syntax error.

### Note
- The syntax shown above does not include all of the clauses of the SELECT statement. You'll learn about the other clauses later in this book.

## SELECT Statement Examples
- Figure 3-2 presents five SELECT statement examples. All of these statements retrieve data from the Invoices table that you experimented with in the last chapter. After each statement, you can see its result set as displayed by MySQL Workbench. In these examples, a horizontal or vertical scroll bar indicates that the result set contains more rows or columns than can be displayed at one time. 
- The first statement in this figure retrieves all of the rows and columns from the Invoices table. Here, an asterisk * is used as a shorthand to indicate that all of the columns should be retrieved, and the WHERE and LIMIT clauses are omitted so all of the rows in the table are retrieved. In addition, this statement doesn't include an ORDER BY clause, so the rows are in primary key sequence. 
- The second statement retrieves selected columns from the Invoices table. These columns are listed in the SELECT clause. Like the first statement, this statement doesn't include a WHERE or a LIMIT clause, so all the rows are retrieved. Then, the ORDER BY clause causes the rows to be sorted by the invoice_total column in descending order, from largest to smallest. 
- The third statement also lists the columns to be retrieved. In this case, though, the last column is calculated from two columns in the base table, credit_total and payment_total, and the resulting column is given the name total_credits. In addition, the WHERE clause specifies that only the invoice whose invoice_id column has a value of 17 should be retrieved. 
- The fourth SELECT statement includes a WHERE clause whose condition specifies a range of values. In this case, only invoices with invoice dates between 06/01/2018 and 06/30/2018 are retrieved. In addition, the rows in the result set are sorted by invoice date. 
- The last statement in this figure shows another example of the WHERE clause. In this case, only those rows with invoice totals greater than 50,000 are retrieved. Since none of the rows in the Invoices table satisfy this condition, the result set is empty.

## How to code the SELECT clause
Now that you have a general idea of how the main clauses of a SELECT statement work, you're ready to learn the details for coding the first clause, the SELECT clause. You can use this clause to specify the columns for a result set.
### How to code column specifications
- Figure 3-3 begins by presenting a more detailed syntax for the SELECT clause. In this syntax, you can choose between the items in a syntax summary that are separated by pipes ( I ), and you can omit items enclosed in brackets ( [ ] ). If you have a choice between two or more optional items, the default item is underlined. And if an element can be coded multiple times in a statement, it's followed by an ellipsis ( ... ). 
- This figure continues by summarizing four techniques you can use to specify the columns for a result set. First, you can code an asterisk in the SELECT clause to retrieve all of the columns in the base table. When you use this technique, MySQL returns the columns in the order that they are defined in the base table. 
- Second, you can code a list of column names from the base table separated by commas. In this figure, for instance, the second example specifies three columns that are in the Vendors table. 
- Third, you can code an expression that uses arithmetic operators. The result of an expression is a single value. In this figure, for instance, the third example uses an expression to subtract the payment_total and credit_total columns from the invoice total column and return the balance due. 
- Fourth, you can code an expression that uses functions. In this figure, for instance, the fourth example uses the CONCAT function to join a column named first_name, a space, and a column named last_name. Here, two single quotes are used to identify the literal value for the space. 
- When you code the SELECT clause, you should include only the columns you need. For example, you shouldn't code an asterisk to retrieve all the columns unless you need all the columns. That's because the amount of data that's retrieved can affect system performance. This is particularly important if you're developing SQL statements that will be used by application programs. 
- For now, don't worry if you don't completely understand all four techniques. In the next four figures, you'll learn 1nore about how they work.

### The expanded syntax of the SELECT clause
![[Pasted image 20220907195757.png]]
### Four ways to code column specifications
|Source|Option|Syntax|
|-|-|-|
|Base table value | All Columns <br> Column name| * <br> column_name
|Calculated value| Result of a calculation <br> Result of a function| Arithmetic expressions <br> Functions
### Column specifications that use base table values
- The * is used to retrieve all columns
	- SELECT *
- Column names are used to retrieve specific columns
	- SELECT vendor_name, vendor_city, vendor_state
### Column specifications that use calculated values
- An arithmetic expression that calculates the balance due
	- SELECT invoice_table - payment_total - credit_total AS balance_due
- A function that returns the full name
	- SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name

### Description
- Use SELECT * only when you need to retrieve all of the columns from a table. Otherwise, list the names of the columns you need. 
- An expression is a combination of column names and operators that evaluate to a single value. In the SELECT clause, you can code expressions that include one or more arithmetic operators and expressions that include one or more functions. 
- After each column specification, you can code an AS clause to specify the name for the column in the result set. See figure 3-4 for details.
### Note
- The ALL and DISTINCT keywords specify whether or not duplicate rows are returned.

## How to name the columns in a result set using aliases
- By default, MySQL gives a column in a result set the same name as the column in the base table. If the column is based on a calculated value, it's assigned a name based on the expression for the value. However, whenever you want, you can specify a different name known as a column alias as shown in figure 3-4. 
- To assign a column alias, you code the column specification followed by the AS keyword and the new name as shown by the first example in this figure. Here, the statement creates an alias of ''Invoice Number'' for the invoice_number column, ''Date'' for the invoice_date column, and ''Total'' for the invoice_total column. To include a space in the alias for the first column, this statement encloses that alias in double quotes ( " ). 
- The second example in this figure shows what happens when you don't assign an alias to a calculated column. In that case, MySQL automatically assigns the column an alias that's the same as the column's expression. Since the expressions for many calculated values are cumbersome, you typically assign a shorter alias for calculated values as shown throughout the rest of this chapter.

### A SELECT statement that renames the columns in the result set
![[Pasted image 20220907200806.png]]
### A SELECT statement that doesn't name a calculated column
![[Pasted image 20220907200834.png]]
### Description
- By default, a column in the result set is given the same name as the column in the base table. If that's not what you want, you can specify a substitute name, or column alias, for the column. 
- To specify an alias for a column, use the AS phrase. Although the AS keyword is optional, I recommend you code it for readability. 
- If you don't specify an alias for a column that's based on a calculated value, MySQL uses the expression for the calculated value as the column name. 
- To include spaces or special characters in an alias, enclose the alias in double quotes ( " ) or single quotes ( ' ).

## How to code arithmetic expressions
- Figure 3-5 shows how to code arithmetic expressions. To start, it summarizes the arithmetic operators you can use in this type of expression. Then, it presents three examples that show bow you use these operators. 
- The SELECT statement in the first example includes an arithmetic expression that calculates the balance due for an invoice. This expression subtracts the payment_total and credit_total columns from the invoice_total column. The resulting column is given an alias of balance_due. 
- When MySQL evaluates an arithmetic expression, it performs the operations from left to right based on the order of precedence. To start, MySQL performs multiplication, division, and modulo operations. Then, it performs addition and subtraction operations. 
- If that's not what you want, you can use parentheses to specify how an expression is evaluated. Then, MySQL evaluates the expressions in the innermost sets of parentheses first, followed by the expressions in outer sets of parentheses. Within each set of parentheses, MySQL evaluates the expression from left to right in the order of precedence. 
- If you want, you can also use parentheses to clarify an expression even if they're not needed for the expression to be evaluated properly. However, you should avoid cluttering your SQL statements with unnecessary parentheses. 
- To show how parentheses and the order of precedence affect the evaluation of an expression, consider the second example in this figure. Here, the expressions in the second and third columns both perform the same operations. These expressions use one column name (invoice_id) that returns a number and two literal values for numbers (7 and 3). When you code a literal value for a number, you don't need to enclose it in quotes. 
- When MySQL evaluates the exp1·ession in the second column, it perfo1ms the multiplication operation before the addition operation because multiplication comes before addition in the order of precedence. When MySQL evaluates the expression in the third column, though, it perfor1ns the addition operation first because it's enclosed in parentheses. Because of this, these two expressions return different values as shown in the result set. 
- Although you're probably familiar with the addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operators, you may not be familiar with the MOD (%) or DIV operators. MOD returns the remainder of a division of two integers, and DIV returns the integer quotient of two numbers. These are shown in the third example in this figure. Here, the second column contains the quotient of the two numbers, which MySQL automatically converts from an integer value to a decimal value. Then, the third column uses the DIV operator to return the integer quotient of the same division operation. The fourth column uses the modulo operator to return the remainder of the division operation. 
- Before going on, you should notice that the second and third SELECT statements include an ORDER BY clause that sorts the result set in ascending sequence by the invoice_id column. Although you might think that this would be the default, that's not the case with MySQL. Instead, the rows in a result set are returned in the most efficient way. If you want the rows returned in a specific sequence, then, you need to include the ORDER BY clause.

### The arithmetic operators in order of precedence
|Operator|Name|Order of precedence|
|-|-|-|
|* | Multiplication | 1 |
|/|Division|1|
|DIV|Integer Division| 1|
|% MOD|Modulo (remainder)| 1|
|+|Addition|2|
|-|Subtration|2|

### Use parentheses to control the sequence of operations
![[Pasted image 20220908215428.png]]
### Use the DIV and modulo operators
![[Pasted image 20220908215445.png]]
### Description
- Unless parentheses are used, the operations in an expression take place from left to right in the order of precedence. For arithmetic expressions, MySQL performs multiplication, division, and modulo operations first. Then, it performs addition and subtraction operations. 
- When necessary, you can use parentheses to override or clarify the sequence of operations.

## How to use CONCAT function to join strings
- Figure 3-6 presents the CONCAT function and shows you how to use it to join, or concatenate, strings. In MySQL, a string can contain any combination of characters, and a function performs an operation and returns a value. To code a function, you begin by entering its name followed by a set of parentheses. If the function requires an argument, or parameter, you enter it within the parentheses. If the function takes more than one argument, you separate them with commas. 
- In this figure, the first example shows how to use the CONCAT function to join the vendor_city and vendor_state columns in the Vendors table. Since this example doesn't assign an alias to this column, MySQL automatically assigns the expression formula as the column name. In addition, there isn't a space between the vendor_state and the vendor_city in the result set. Since this makes the data difficult to read, this string should be formatted as shown in the second or third example. 
- The second example shows how to format a string expression by adding spaces and punctuation. Here, the vendor_city column is concatenated with a literal value for a string that contains a comma and a space. Then, the vendor_state column is concatenated with that result, followed by a literal value for a string that contains a single space and the vendor_zip_code column. 
- To code a string literal, you can enclose the value in either single quotes ( ' ) or double quotes ( " ). Occasionally, you may need to include a single quote as an apostrophe within a literal value for a string. If you're using single quotes around the literal, however, MySQL will misinterpret the aposn·ophe as the end of the string. To solve this, you can code two single quotation marks in a row as shown by the third example. Or, you can use double quotes like this: 
	- CONCAT(vendor_name, "'s Address: ") AS vendor

![[Pasted image 20220908215734.png]]
### How to include apostrophes in literal values
![[Pasted image 20220908215755.png]]
### Description
- An expression can include any of the functions that are supported by MySQL. A function performs an operation and returns a value.
- To code a function, code the function name followed by a set of parentheses. Within the parentheses, code any parameters, or arguments, required by the function. If a function requires two or more arguments, separate them with commas. 
- To code a literal value for a string, enclose one or more characters within single quotes ( ' ) or double quotes ( " ). 
- To include a single quote within a literal value for a string, code two single quotes. Or, use double quotes instead of single quotes to start and end the literal value.
- To join, or concatenate, two or more string columns or literal values, use the CONCAT function.

## How to use functions with strings, dates, and numbers
- Figure 3-7 shows how to work with three more functions. The LEFT function operates on strings, the DATE_FORMAT function operates on dates, and the ROUND function operates on numbers. For now, don't worry about the details of how the functions shown here work, because you'll learn more about all of these functions in chapter 9. Instead, just focus on how they're used in column specifications. 
- The first example in this figure shows how to use the LEFT function to extract the first character of the vendor_contact_frrst_name and vendor_contact_last_name columns. The first parameter of this function specifies the string value, and the second parameter specifies the number of characters to return. Then, this statement concatenates the results of the two LEFT functions to form initials as shown in the result set. 
- The second example shows how to use the DATE_FORMAT function to change the format used to display date values. This function requires two parameters. The first parameter is the date value to be formatted and the second is a format string that uses specific values as placeholders for the various parts of the date. The first column in this example returns the invoice_date column in the default MySQL date format, ''yyyy-mm-dd''. Since this format isn't used as often in the USA, the second column is formatted in the more typical ''mm/dd/yy'' format. In the third column, the invoice date is in another format that's commonly used. In chapter 9, you'll learn more about specifying the format string for the DATE_FORMAT function. 
- The third example uses the ROUND function to round the value of the invoice total column to the nearest dollar and nearest dime. This function can - accept eitl1er one or two parameters. The first parameter specifies the number to be rounded and the optional second parameter specifies the number of decimal places to keep. If the second parameter is omitted, the function rounds to the nearest integer.
### The syntax of the LEFT, DATE_FORMAT, and ROUND functions
- LEFT(string, number_of_characters)
- DATE_FORMAT(date, format_string)
- ROUND(number[, number_of_decimal_places])
### A SELECT statement that uses the LEFT function
![[Pasted image 20220908220238.png]]
### A SELECT statement that uses the DATE_FORMAT function
![[Pasted image 20220908220308.png]]
### A SELECT statement that uses the ROUND function
![[Pasted image 20220908220331.png]]
### Description
- When using the DATE_FORMAT function to specify the format of a date, you use the percent sign (%) to identify a format code. For example, a format code of m returns the month number with a leading zero if necessary. For more information about these codes, see chapter 9. 
- For more information about using functions, see chapter 9.

## How to test expressions by coding statements without FROM clauses
- When you use MySQL, you don't have to code FROM clat1ses in SELECT statements. This makes it easy for you to code SELECT statements that test expressions and functions like those that you've seen in this chapter. Instead of coding column specifications in the SELECT clause, you use literals or functions to supply the test values you need. And you code column aliases to display the results. Then, once you're sure that the code works as you intend it to, you can add the FROM clause and replace the literals or functions with the correct column specifications. 
- Figure 3-8 shows how to test expressions. Here, the first example tests an arithmetic expression using numeric literals that make it easy to verify the results. The remaining examples test the functions that you saw in figure 3-7. If you compare these statements, you'll see that the second and fourth examples simply replace the column specifications in figure 3-7 with literal values. The third example uses another function, CURRENT_DATE, to supply a date value in place of the invoice_date column that's coded in figure 3-7.
### Four SELECT statements without FROM clauses
#### EXAMPLE 1: Testing a calculation
![[Pasted image 20220908220519.png]]
#### EXAMPLE 2: Testing the CONCAT function

#### EXAMPLE 3: Testing the DATE_FORMAT function
![[Pasted image 20220908220614.png]]
#### EXAMPLE 4: 
![[Pasted image 20220908220634.png]]
### Description
- With MySQL, you don't have to code a FROM clause. This makes it easy to test expressions that include arithmetic operators and functions. 
- The CURRENT _ DATE function returns the current date. The parentheses are optional for this function.

## How to eliminate duplicate rows
- By default, all of the rows in the base table that satisfy the search condition in the WHERE clause are included in the result set. In some cases, though, that means that the result set will contain duplicate rows, or rows whose column values are identical. If that's not what you want, you can include the DISTINCT keyword in the SELECT clause to eliminate the duplicate rows. 
- Figure 3-9 shows how this works. Here, both SELECT statements retrieve the vendor_city and vendor_state columns from the Vendors table. The first statement doesn't include the DISTINCT keyword. Because of that, the same city and state can appear in the result set more than once. In the results shown in this figure, for example, you can see that Anaheim CA occurs twice and Boston MA occurs three times. In contrast, the second statement includes the DISTINCT keyword, so each city and state combination is included only once.
### A SELECT statement that returns all rows
![[Pasted image 20220908220815.png]]
### A SELECT statement that eliminates duplicate rows
![[Pasted image 20220908220855.png]]
### Description
- The DISTINCT keyword prevents duplicate (identical) rows from being included in the result set. DISTINCTROW is a synonym for DISTINCT. 
- The ALL keyword causes all rows matching the search condition to be included in the result set, regardless of whether rows are duplicated. Since this is the defat1lt, you'll usually omit the ALL keyword. 
- To use the DISTINCT or ALL keyword, code it immediately after the SELECT keyword as shown above.
