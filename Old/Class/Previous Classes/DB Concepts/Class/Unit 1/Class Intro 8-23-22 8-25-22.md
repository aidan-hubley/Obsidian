# Knowing Standard Structured Query Language (SQL)
1. Basic SQL statements are the same for all dialects
2. Once you know one dialect, you can easier learn others
3. However, most applications require modification when moved to another database
# The Database Environment
## Importance of Databases
1. The global economy and enterprises are dependent on the efficient and effective management of data and information
	1. Including church and para-church (missions, etc.) organizations
2. Databases have been one of the top breakthroughs in computing

# Database Application
1. Application programs used to perform a series of activities on behalf of database users
2. Typically, database perform **CRUD** operations:
	1. **C**reate: add new data to the database
	2. **R**ead: read current database data
	3. **U**pdate: update (modify) current database data
	4. **D**elete: delete current data from the databse
