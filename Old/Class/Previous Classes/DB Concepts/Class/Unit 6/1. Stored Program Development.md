# Stored Programs
- Stored Procedure
	- An application can call a stored procedure (i.e. PHP application)
- Stored Function
	- A user-defined function used in a similar fashion to system-defined functions (i.e. sum())
- Trigger
	- Code to be executed when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE is performed
- Event
	- Code that is scheduled
# Stored Procedure Statements
- Statements used for controlling the flow of execution
	- IF...ELSEIF...ELSE
	- CASE...WHEN...ELSE
	- WHILE...DO...LOOP
	- REPEAT...UNTIL...END REPEAT
	- DECLARE CURSOR FOR
	- DECALRE...HANDLER
- SQL Statements used in Stored Programs
	- SELECT

# Stored Programs Key Points
- Procedure
	- Considered a "Stored Routine"
	- Invoked using a CALL statement
	- Pass back values using output variables
	- May or may not return a value, but can return up to 1024 values
	- Normally used to execute business logic
- Function
	- Considered a "Stored Routine"
	- Called inside a statement
	- Always returns a one and only one value
	- Normally used for computation
- Trigger
	- A stored program that is executed when an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE occur on a table (specified in the Trigger)

# Variables
- Declaring a variable
	- DECLARE variable_name data_type [DEFAULT literal_value];
- Setting a varaible
	- SET varaible_name = literal_value_or_expression;
- Setting a variable in a SELECT
	- SELECT column_q [, column_2] . . .
	- INTO variable_name_1 [, variable_name_2]. . .

# Cursor
- A **cursor** allows you to iterate a set of rows returned by a query and process each row individually
- **MySQL cursor** is read-only, non-scrollable and asensitive
- You cannot fetch rows in the reversed order. In addition, you cannot skip rows or jump to a specific row in the result set
