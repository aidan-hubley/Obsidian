# Entity-Relationship Data Modeling
## Intro to ER Data Model
- Original ER (Entity-Relationship) data model developed by Peter Chen in 1976 and modeled systems as data entity, relationship and attribute types
- The ER Diagram is a notation use to **graphically represent data models**; there are many different ER modeling notations
- In 1998 ANSI chose the ER model as a standard for information Resource Dictionary Systems (IRDSs)
- Extensions to ER model
	- Composite attributes
	- Generalization hierarchies

# Entity Types
## Entity Type Versus Instance
- Types
	- Represent Real-World Objects
		- Persons, places, and things
	- Associated Descriptive Information
		- Defines the real-world object
	- Maps to a Table
- Instance
	- An Occurrence of an Entity Type
		- With actual descriptive information
		- Described by the Entity Type
	- Maps to a Row
## Entity Types and Entities

## Defining Entity Types
- An entity types is defined in terms of:
	- a unique mnemonic entity type name,
	- optional attribute types,
	- one or more relationships types the entity type participates in,
	- an identifier or index (one or more designated attribute types) whose values(s) identify entity instances
		- A key identifier or index (one or more designated attribute types) whose value(s) uniquely identifies each entity instance
## Entity Notional Conventions
- Different ER data modeling tools and techniques represent entity type information differently
- We will define several notational schemes

## Entity Definition Guidelines
- Nouns (people, place, things) suggest entities
- Something that has attributes or descriptive qualifiers maty suggest an entity
- If any entity contains many things, maybe it contains many entities
- If multiple entities have the same properties, they may be the same entity
## Strong and Weak Entities
- A strong entity type is one that exists independent of other entity types
	- Examples: Student, Employee, Car, Course
- A weak entity type is one whose existence depends on some other entity type
	- Examples: Dependent, Address

## Class Exercise
A **company** consists of a number of business units.  
Every **product** in our company must be managed by  
one and only one **business unit**. Each business unit  
has multiple products it manages. An **employee** is  
assigned to a single product. Products must have  
unique names. They also have prices and  
descriptions. Each business unit has a name that is  
unique within the company.  

What entity type names (conceptual schema) are  
suggested by the above description? Entity types  
only!

# Entity Standards
## Entity Naming
- Meaningful, Real-World objects, Singular Noun
- Unique throughout Data Model
- Limit 40 characters
- Multiple-word Names
	- Each word Title-Case
	- Underscore between words
- Use (PK) or (FK) in the diagram only

# Relationships
## Relationship Types and Instances
- Relationship Types
	- Represents association between real-world objects such as course being offered by a school
	- Defines a named association between two or more entity types
- A relationship instance is an individual occurrence of a relationship type that conforms to the relationship type definition
## Defining Relationships
- A relationship is defined in terms of:
	- a unique mnemonic relationship type that is usually a verb phrase (Assigned_To, Supplies, Teaches)
	- a set of source (or outgoing) entities
	- a set of target (or incoming) entities
	- optional attributes
	- cardinality (optional upper and lower bounds)
	- whether or not the referential integrity property applies to this relationship type
	- an optional set of key attributes
	- an optional reverse relationship type name
## Relationship Types Notations
![[Pasted image 20221025124000.png]]
## Recursive Relationships
- An association of Entity Type with itself
- Example: Employee Manages another Employee

# Relationship Standards
## Relationship Naming
- Action-oriented Reflecting the nature of the underlying relationship
- Unique throughout the Data Model
- Limit 40 characters
- Multiple-word names
	- Each word Title-Case
	- Underscore between words
- Use a triangle pointing the reading direction of the name
## Relationship Cardinality
### Cardinality
- Cardinality: Given a single occurrence of Entity A, how many occurrences of Entity B can be associated with it?
- The numbers are located next to Entity B.
- Cardinality is defined by giving two bounds:  
	- Lower Bound  
		- integer identifying the minimum number of occurrences of Entity B relating to Entity A  
		- If absent, the lower bound is assumed to be 0  
	- Upper Bound of a relationship type R is an  
		- integer defining the maximum number of occurrences of Entity B relating to Entity A  
		- The asterisk symbol (*) is used to denote many.  
- Repeat starting with Entity B.
- Cardinality 1:1 => relationship type in which at most one instance of an entity is related to another instance of an entity 
	- Each worker is assigned to a unique mail box and for each mail box there is a unique worker assigned to it
- Cardinality 1:Many => relationship type in which for a given entity instance there may be 0 or many instances related to an entity  
	- A school offers many courses
- Cardinality Many: Many => relationship type in which for a given entity instance A, there may be 0 or many instances of entity B related to A and for an instance of entity B there are 0 or more instances of A  
	- Employees can be assigned to many projects 
	- Projects can have many employees assigned to them
