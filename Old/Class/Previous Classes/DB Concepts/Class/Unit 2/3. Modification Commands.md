# SQL Modification Commands

## Insert
Insert a row to a table
### Insert syntax
- INSERT [INTO] table_name [(column_list)]
	- VALUES (expression_1 [,expression2].....)
	- [, (expression_1 [expression2])]

Example:
- INSERT INTO invoices
	- (vendor_id, invoice_number, invoice_total, terms_id, invoice_date, invoice_due, invoice_due_date)
- VALUES
	- (97, '456789', 8344.50, 1, '2014-08-01', '2014-08-31')

Inserting a new row and need the newly created ID?
- SET @(most recent column_list edited) = last_inserted_id();

## Update
Update a cell(s) in a table
### Update Syntax
- UPDATE table_name SET column_name_1 = expression_1
	- [, column_name_2 = expression_2] ...
- WHERE search_condition

Example:
- UPDATE invoices
- SET payment_date = '2014-09-21',
	- payment_total = 19351.16
- WHERE invoice_number = '97/522'

### MySQL Workbench Safe Mode
- By default, MySQL Workbench runs in safe update mode.  
- Safe update mode prevents you from updating rows if the WHERE clause is omitted or doesn’t refer to a primary key or foreign key column.  
- You can turn safe update mode off by selecting the Edit->Preferences command, selecting the SQL Editor tab, changing the “safe update” option, and restarting MySQL Workbench.  
- **Warning**: If you turn off safe update mode and omit the WHERE clause, all rows in the table will be updated.

### UPDATE Using a SELECT Statement
- UPDATE invoices
- SET terms_id = 1
- WHERE vendor_id =
	- ( SELECT vendor_id
	- FROM vendors
	- WHERE vendor_name = 'Pacific Bell'
	- )

- UPDATE invoices
- SET terms_id = 1
- WHERE vendor_id IN
	- ( SELECT vendor_id
	- FROM vendors
	- WHERE vendor state IN ('CA', 'AZ', 'NV' )
	- )


## DELETE
Delete an entire row
### DELETE Syntax
- DELETE FROM table_name
	- [WHERE search_condition]

Examples:
- DELETE FROM general_ledger_accounts
- WHERE account_number = 306;

- DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
- WHERE invoice_id = 12;

### DELETE Using SELECT Statement
- DELETE FROM invoice_line_items
- WHERE invoice_id IN
	- ( SELECT invoice_id
	- FROM invoices
	- WHERE vendor_id = 115
	- )
- **Warning**: If you turn safe update mode off in MySQL Workbench and omit the WHERE clause from a DELETE statement, all the rows in the table will be deleted.


## Creating Tables with SELECT Statement

### CREATE TABLE table_name AS select_statment
- Copying ALL Rows
	- CREATE TABLE invoices_copy AS
	- SELECT *
	- FROM invoices
- Copying Some Rows
	- CREATE TABLE old_invoices AS
	- SELECT *
	- FROM invoices
	- WHERE invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total = 0;

### CREATE TABLE Using Functions for Columns
- CREATE TABLE vendor_balances AS  
- SELECT vendor_id, SUM(invoice_total) AS sum_of_invoices  
- FROM invoices  
- WHERE (invoice_total - payment_total - credit_total) <> 0  
- GROUP BY vendor_id
