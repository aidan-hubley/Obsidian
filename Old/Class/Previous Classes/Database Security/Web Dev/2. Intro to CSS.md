# Style Origins
- Browser Default
- Developer
- User Over-riding Styles

# Placement for CSS
- (External) File external to the html file  
	- Benefit: One File to rule them all  
	- Benefit: One place to fix  
- (Internal) Within html file in \<head> using \<style>  
	- Benefit: Styles common to a page  
	- Benefit: Easy to edit for that page  
	- Drawback: styles for multiple pages must be duplicated...  
	- Drawback: with same-named style conflicts, the one in the html file “wins”  
- (Inline) Within tag using style attribute  
	- Benefit: Style single element  
	- Benefit: Quick fix  
	- Drawback: over-rides all others  
	- Drawback: too specific  
	- Avoid using this method unless absolutely necessary

# "Cascading"
- Multiple styles possible for each element  
- Which style “wins” when conflicting - determined by the “cascade”  
- Priority Order (lowest to highest):  
	- (LOW) Browser Default   
	- External style sheet (file)  
		- Multiple files possible  
		- Order applied: top to bottom (first encountered to last encountered)  
- Internal style sheet (in the head section)  
	- Order applied: top to bottom (first encountered to last encountered)  
		- (HIGH) Inline style (inside an HTML element)

# HTML and CSS Interaction
![[Pasted image 20230209105955.png]]

## Location for CSS: Internal
~~~ html
<html>  
<head>  
	<title>Home</title>  
	<style rel=“stylesheet”>  
		body {  
			background-color: #000000;  
		}  
	</style>  
</head>  
<body>  
...
~~~

## Location for CSS: In Line
~~~ html
<html>  
<head>  
	<title>Home</title>  
</head>  
<body style=“background-color: #000000;” >  
...
~~~

# CSS Style Syntax: Selector
- Element: an element name (i.e. p)  
	- Make the font of all paragraph elements blue  
		p { color: blue; }  
- ID: an element with the given id  
	- Make the background color of the element with id: “navigation” #909090 (grey):  
		\#navigation { background-color: #909090; }  
	- ID values must be unique  
	- “#” distinguishes it as an id  
- Class: an element with the given class  
	- Make all elements with class: “article” float left  
		.article { float: left; }  
- “.” distinguishes it as a class.

# Multiple Classes per element
- Elements may only have single ID, but multiple classes
**style.css:**
~~~ css
blueBox {  
	background-color: blue;  
}  
.important {  
	color: red;  
}
~~~
myPage.html:
~~~ html
<p class=“blueBox”>  
	Welcome to the world of Sports.  
</p>  
<p class=“blueBox important”>  
	You have 3 days until your account is terminated.  
</p>
~~~

# Selector by Position
~~~ css
ul .important {
	color: green;
}
~~~
- Finding by “parent”  
- Make the font color green for all elements with the class “important” that are in any \<ul>  
- Space indicates “select the descendants of...”  
- This works for any number of selectors listed.

# Element with Class Selectors
~~~ css
li.important {
	background-color: purple;
}
~~~
- Specific elements by class (or id)
- Make the background of all \<li> elements with the class "important", purple.
- Without a space indicates, "select all elements with the class ..."

# Very Complex!
~~~ css
#main div.article form label.important
{
	color:#993333;
}
~~~
- This selects all
	- label elements with a class of "important" that are
		- descendants of any form element that are
		- descendants of all div elements with a class of "article" that are
		- in the element whose id is "main"

# Pseudo Class
- Pseudo classes allow you to style elements based on their "state." The most often element used is the anchor (\<a>) element
~~~ css
a:link {  
	color: darkblue;  
}  
a:visited {  
	color: purple;  
}  
a:hover {  
	color: red;  
}  
a:active {  
	color: green;  
}  
a:focus {  
	color: green;  
}
~~~

# Grouping Selectors
- You can apply the same styling to a group of selectors simply by separating them with commas.
~~~ css
a:link, a:visited, a:active, a:focus {  
	color: darkblue;  
}  
a:hover {  
	color: red;  
}
~~~

# Cascading - Clashing Rules
- What happens when multiple rules clash?
- "Order of Operations"
	- id is more specific than a class, class is more specific than element
	- the longer the selector, the more specific it is 
	- if style rules are equally specific, the last one wins!

Example: 
~~~ css
body {
	color: #0099cc;
	background-color: #cccccc;
}
