# [Remote Procedure Call]
- Calling function on a machine from another machine
- Many uses / Competitors
	- Network File System
	- MS-DCOM (Distributed Common Object Model)
	- JSON RPC
	- SOAP
- Port 111 (Linux) / 135 (Microsoft) 
	- Port that listening to function calls

# Sniffing
- Manual Sniffer tool:
	- [Wire Shark] - Protocol Analyzer 
- [TCP Dump]
- Promiscuous Mode
	- By default all network interfaces only listen to network traffic meant for itself
	- This mode captures **EVERYTHING**
	- Only root user can enable this mode
- Wi-Fi
	- Easiest place to sniff, you can't stop the radio waves
- [Switch] vs [HUB]
	- Wired networks used to be easy ('70s) to connect to the same physical wire
	- Then ethernet switches (made hubs outdated) essentially privatized sending information over the wired network
	- Spanning port - can be created on a switch to receive **everything**
	- [ARP Poisoning]
		- Layer 2 / Layer 3
		- Switches ask 'who has __ ip address' to everyone
		- If someone lies and say they have someone else's address, they can receive 

# Man in the Middle Attack
![[Pasted image 20230911142658.png]]
- Allows for 
	- Sniffing
	- Drop connection
	- Alter messages
	- Frequently used to ARP Poisoning
- Works best on unencrypted transmissions
- Ettercap
	- Tools suite
	- Helps establish Man in the Middle

# [SSL] / [TLS]
- Originally developed for the wed
- Uses Public Key Cryptography
- Creates a session key
- Used by other protocols (except SSH)
- TLS superseded SSL

## SSL 2.0 Deprecation
- From RFC-6176
- 1. Message authentications used MD5. Most security-aware users have already moved away from any use of MD5
- 2. Handshake messages are not protected. This permits a man-in-the-middle to trick the client it no picking a weaker cipher suite than it would normally choose
- 3. Message integrity and message encryption use the same key, which is a problem if the cilnet and server negotiate a weak encryption algorithm
- 4. Sessions can be easily terminated. A man-in-the-middle can easily insert a TCP FIN to close the session, and the peer is unable to determine whether or not it was a legitimate end of session

# Password Guessing
- Many servers require a password
- These passwords can be guessed
- Dictionary
- Configured separately from your computer
