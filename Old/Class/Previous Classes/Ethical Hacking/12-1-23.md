# OT Systems (cont)

## Internet of Things
- Three Era's
- Early Home Automation
	- X10
	- Z-Wave
	- Zigbee
- FANG Involvement
	- Google Home (Nest)
	- Amazon Home (Alexa)
	- Apple Homekit
- Matter

### Device Observations
- Cheap
- Limited User Interface
- Possibly full OS (Mirai Botnet)
- Ignored
- Excess capacity (Mirai Botnet)
- Useful Sensors

### Simple IOT Hacking
- Baby Monitoring
- Basic Electronic Warfare
- Victure Monitor
	- Hardcoded credentials to access AWS Bucket
	- Could see other user ID's in the Bucket
	- Access other (encrypted) feeds
	- Remote commands uses the camera's ID
	- Guest account with default credentials "ADMIN:123456" that can't be changed in app
	- Buffer Overflow in ONVIF (a security protocol)

#### Roomba
- Camera built into device for object detection and avoidance 
- Special version given to employees and paid users
- Amazon decided to use it to collect data on the object in the house
- Workers using it to train AI image detection
- Pictures showed up on Venezuelan Facebook

#### St Jude Pacemaker
- 2017, FDA recalled 465,000 Pacemakers
- Pacemaker communicated via an Radio Frequency (RF) channel
- CVE-2017-12712: Allows a nearby attacker to compromise or bypass authentication
- CVE-2017-12714: No restriction to the number "wake-up" commands thus draining the battery
- CVE-2017-12716: Certain models did not encrypt patient information and stored patient data in an unencrypted format

## Lessons Learned
- Hardware is older and rarely updated
- Devices have not been subjected to similar evolutionary pressures
- Hacking requires understanding of general hacking and specialized knowledge
- Threat is evolving
