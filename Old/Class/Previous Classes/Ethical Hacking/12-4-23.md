## Two Key Problems in the Webkit
- Kernel memory corruption leads to jailbreak
	- Vulnerability in Safari Webkit lets user execute arbitrary code
	- User needs to be baited into clicking on the suspicious link
	- Kernel use after free
	- What code do we want to execute?
- Kernel Information Leak
	- Kernel Address Space Randomization Layout
	- Function leaks real memory address in the return call

## OSObject and Collections
- IOS stored data in XML
- Needed to encode them into Binary Strings (Serialize)
- Flawed code in turning back binary data into XML
- Data type encoding

## The Attack
- Craft a serialized binary dictionary that contains a malformed OSNumber with over-long size
- Use that serialized dictionary to set properties in a user client object in kernel
- Read the set property (OSNumber) back, leaking adjacent data due to long size
- Use some of the read data to calculate the kernel slide
- Now we can create another dictionary to do a budder overflow (slightly more complicated)
- User our control to change out user ID to 0 (root)
