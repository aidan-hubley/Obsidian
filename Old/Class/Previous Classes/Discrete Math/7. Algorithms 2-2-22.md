# 7.1 Intro to Algorithms
## What is an Algorithm?
1. A step-by-step method for solving a problem (zyBook)
	1. A clearly defined set of instructions
	2. A solution is guaranteed
2. But, a method that **ALMOST** always works is NOT an algorithm (its a heuristic)
	1. A heuristic is a thinking strategy for solving problems efficiently
		1. Accuracy, optimality, etc. are sacrificed for speed
## Resources
1. The amount of resources used by an algorithm is referred to as the algorithm's **computational complexity**
	1. Time and space efficiency are measured in terms of the input size
	2. "The fastest computer in the world, working for billions of years, would not have enough times to find the best route for just a few thousand cities." (W. Daniel Hillis)
2. An algorithm is called "efficient" if the algorithm runs in polynomial time
## Structure
1. A **DESCRIPTION** of an algorithm includes:
	1. **Name** for the algorithm
	2. **Brief Description** of the task performed
	3. **Input** description
	4. **Output** description (specified by Return statement)
	5. A **Sequence of STEPS** including:
		1. Assignments to variables (x:=5)
		2. If-statements (tests condition then executes)
		3. Looping structures
			1. For-loop (# of iterations is determined in advance)
			2. While-loop (ends when a condition becomes false)
			3. Nested loops
	### Example: Algorithm for Pythagorean Triple
	1. What is a **Pythagorean Triple**?
		1. A set of any three whole numbers (a, b, c) that satisfy a^2 + b^2 = c^2
		2. It gives three integral sides of a right triangle
		3. Lets look at algorithms computing these triples written in:
			1. Pseudocode
				1. Blend of English & computer language
			2. C++
			3. Python
			4. Java
