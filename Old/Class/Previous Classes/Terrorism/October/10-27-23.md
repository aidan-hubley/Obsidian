###### Recent Report: "Lone Wolf Terrorists in Europe are not so lonely anymore - Who is radicalizing and recruiting them?"
- Islamist terrorism the biggest threat in Western Europe
- Europol: lone actors will carry out most terrorist attacks in EU
- Most attacks carried out are still solo efforts but
	- Investigations later reveal contacts with others linked to groups
- Al-Qaeda & Islamic State have turned to the Internet because their external operational capabilities have been severely damaged

# Ethical Approach Varies Among Terrorists
- Consequentialism: Terrorisms a lesser form of evil
	- Actions constrained by necessity of gaining support
- Deontology: especially for religious terrorism - 'divine command'
	- Religious imperative often decreases constraints on actions
- "Subversive" Ethics: approach for many terrorist groups
	- Makes **social location**t the starting point for ethics

# Reponses to Terrorism
-- Audrey Kurth Cronin's How Terrorism Ends
- Decapitation
- Negotiations
- Success
- Failure
- Repression
	- Defeating movement by force
- Reorientation
	- Transitioning to another mode of opns
-- "Terrorist campaigns may seem endless, but they always end." --

## Cronin: How Terrorism Ends: Understanding the Decline & Demise of Terrorist Campaigns (2009)
- Three premises foundational to Cronin's analysis:
	- All terrorist movements eventually end
	- Ending terrorist campaigns is difficult
	- In counterterrorism, experience matters
- Cronin focuses on the final years of terrorist groups
	- End of a terrorist group does not necessarily mean peace

### Analysis
- Terrorism: effective method to resist nation-state & rectify injustice
- 20th century: 4 key developments enhanced its effectiveness
	- Enhanced psychological impact of terrorist attacks due to media
	- Rise of state sponsors using terrorism to pursue policy
	- Noteworthy accomplishments by some groups - coercing governments
	- Greater access to more lethal means of destruction
- 21st century: terrorism = a real threat to Western liberal state

### Characteristics & "Strategic Triad"
- Fundamental characteristics of terrorism
	- Political in nature
	- Non-state actors using force
	- Does not abide by international laws/norms
	- Deliberately aims to kill civilians or noncombatants
- Three strategic actors: **terrorist group, government, audience**
	- Dynamic relationship between the three

### Decapitation: Killing or Capturing Leader
- Decapitation: "removal by arrest or assassination of the top leaders or operational leaders of a group" - which is better?
	- Advantages and disadvantages for both
- Arrest (law enforcement approach) => optimal solution
	- Erodes legitimacy of terrorist group with public
	- Provides opportunity for intelligence
	- Can create possible succession struggle
	- Preserves moral high ground
- Disadvantages:
	- Trial outcome is uncertain

### Capturing Leader - Terrorist as Criminal
- Guzman - Shining Path (Peru)
	- 20 yr - 69,000 killed
- 1992 : Guzman & others arrested
	- Publicly humiliated
	- Sentenced to life in prison
	- Violence fell by 50% (chart, p20)
	- Government offered amnesty to others

- Ocalan - PKK (Turkey)
	- Attacks on government
	- 37,000 killed
- 1999: Ocalan arrested
	- Tried & sentenced to death
	- PKK ceased attacks
	- 5 year ceasefire - political only

### Killing Leader - Terrorist as a Combatant
- Assassination or "targeted killing" (warfighting approach)
	- Ethics of this approach subject of heated debates
	- U.S. banned assassination under Ford, Carter, Reagan
	- Impact of Geneva Convention and Just War tradition
- Can be counterproductive: vulnerability of governmental leaders: undermines moral high ground; leads to 2nd & 3rd order effects
	- 2nd Order effects - When action is taken, what are unintended consequences
		- Example: kill the leader, a better lead rises; increase attacks or recruiting

- 1992: Abdurajak Janjalani - Abu Sayyaf - Killed by police
- Russia -> Chechen leaders
	- Aggressive campaign by Russia
	- 2002-2006: multiple killings
	- Brutal cycle of killing & retribution
- Israel's "targeted killings"
### Decapitation (Arrest or Killing) Assessment
- Unlikely to succeed if group has widespread public support
- Overall, arrests more effective than killings in damaging groups
	- Often more difficult to capture than to kill leaders
	- Process after arrest is crucial
- Effect on audience as important as impact on group itself
- **Ethical & strategic error to assume retaliatory killings are legit**
