# Ways That Terrorist Movements End

## Negotiations - Cronin's How Terrorism Ends
- Negotiations: discussions between government & terrorist group
	- NOT about negotiations with state sponsors of terrorism
- **Claim: "Democracies DO NOT negotiate with terrorists."**
	- Belief that negotiation creates incentives for future attacks
	- Avoids recognizing the terrorist group & providing legitimacy
- **Reality: Democracies DO negotiate with terrorists**

### Reality of Negotiations
- Negotiations are common in a variety of forms
	- But negotiations by themselves rarely end terrorist movements
	- Can help to manage levels over terrorist violence over time
- Patterns for negotiations involving terrorist groups
	- Only about 1 in 5 groups negotiate - tend to be "older" groups
	- Most negotiations do not clearly resolve the conflict
	- ~half of groups that negotiate continue violence usually at lower levels
-- Negotiations process tends to be long and very difficult --

### Why do Government's Negotiate?
- Can reduce terrorist violence over the long term
	- Also potential for short term pause in violence
- Can provide opportunity to gather intelligence on terrorists
	- Offer insights into terrorist motivations, tactics, org, etc.
- Can create factions within the cause - opp for divide & conquer
- Undermine terrorist claim that no alternative exists -- affects triad

### Why Governments Do NOT negotiate
- Belief that negotiation creates incentives for future attacks
- Avoids recognizing the terrorist group & providing legitimacy
- Fear that negotiation
	- can increase terrorist violence over the short term
	- can lead to governmental collapse - especially in coalition governments
- Disappointment in outcome of negotiations -> loss of support
-- Negotiate officially only when terrorist org is gaining support / legitimacy --

### Why do Terrorist Groups Negotiate?
- Can provide legitimacy in eyes of audience
- Can make the government appear weak
- Groups that negotiate have longer lifespan
	- Nearly always pursue control of territory
- Shift in ideology or refinement of goals
	- Difference between public claims and private goals

### Why Terrorist Groups DO NOT Negotiate?
- Most states want conflicts to end - many terrorist organizations do not
	- Violence can be intrinsic to identity of the organization or its leaders
- Violence may be the only card terrorists have to play
- Government violence may increase legitimacy & support of group

### General: Terrorists Group Negotiations
- Most groups do **NOT** negotiate - only about 18% try
	- Study of 457 terrorist groups active since 1968
- Of those that do negotiate, only about 1 in 10 clearly fail
- Yet, of the 9 in 10 that don't fail, few fully achieve objectives
- Fully negotiated and final peace settlements are rare

## Case Study: Northern Ireland Peace Process
- Intermittent process, took over 20 years, with many stops and starts
- Sectarian violence rose and fell over the years
	- **Public opinion shifted towards peaceful resolution**
- 2005: PIRA ends armed campaign
- Political process replaced terrorism

## Keys to **SUCCESS** of Negotiations
- Sense of stalemate
	- Recognition that violence could not be ended by military means
	- Divisions among militant groups - fear of losing ground
- Increasing investment in peace process by all sides
- "Strategic ambiguity" of final peace agreement

## Case Study: Israeli-Palestinian Peace Process
- Popular uprising created incentives for both sides to negotiate
- Agreements made but not supported by coalitions or public audience
- Terrorism increased at key points
	- 1995 assassination of PM Rabin
- Election of Likud government

## Keys to Failure of Negotiations
- Increased waves of suicide attacks during key phases
- HAMAS and PIJ sought to spoil peace process
	- Palestinian Authority unwilling or unable to stop them
- Competition among various Palestinian factions for control
- Palestinian public began to see terror attacks as assisting process
	- Belief negotiations alone would never lead to Israeli withdrawal

## Promising / Unpromising Circumstances for Negotiations
- Perceived stalemate
- Strong Leadership on both sides
- Third part sponsors
- Suicide attacks
- Splintering groups
- Spoilers - work both ways

## Success: Achieving Objectives
- Terrorist groups rarely achieve success
	- Takes time - survival is key
	- Average length of time terrorist groups survive ~ 8 years
		- Longevity is the exception - connection to territory is key
- Success of terrorism does not legitimize the tactics
- Success depends on achievements and effects on population
	- **Does it achieve benefits on behalf of those it fights for?**
