- Daesh: al-dowla al-islaamiuyya fil-il-i'raaq wa-ash-shaam
	- Arabic: acronym forms a word meaning "to trample down and crush"
- ~2000: founded as "Jama'at al-Tawhid wal-jihad" (monotheism & jihad)
- 2004: Affiliated with Al-Qaeda > became Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI)
- ~2010: Split from AQ, changed to Islamic State in Iraq (later ISIS)
	- 2014: declared establishment of Caliphate > **insurgency & police state**
- Political system: militant Sunni Islamic jihadists

## Primary Actors

- 2014-2019: Abu Bakr Al-Baghdadi (Iraqi)
- United States & its allies
- Post-2004 Government of Iraq

## Causal Factors
- Influence of Afghan insurgency against Soviet Union
- Influence of Al-Qaeda - especially on Zarqawi in early 200s
- US invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003
- Establishment of Shiite-dominated government in Iraq

## Ideology
- **Sunni** Islamic jihadists - religious ideology
- Islam under siege by West
- Democracy: "wicked ideology"
- Local governments as "apostates"
	- apostates - those who have left the faith
- Islamic Caliphate needed **now**
	- "Top down" vs Al-Qaeda's "bottom up"
- Jihad must be global
- **Hostility toward Islamic minorities**
- Religious terminology frames conflict
	- Believers, Infidels, Apostates

"In jihadism were to be placed on a political spectrum, al-Qaeda would be its left and the Islamic State its right." (Johnson, 17)

## Objectives

## Operations, Tactics, Effects
- Major Operations:
	- 2003-2006: Insurgency against US troops in Iraq

	- 2014-2018: Seized control of much of Iraq - pushed into Syria
- Tactics:
	- Bombings, assassinations, massacres, crucifixions, beheadings
	- More intense violence than AQ, often focused on non-combatants
