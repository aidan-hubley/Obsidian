-- Recap of frameworks --
- [**Consequentialism**]: emphasis on the greatest amount of right outcomes
- **[Deontology]**: emphasis on right action / duty over outcome
- **[Virtue]**: emphasis on character as the foundation for right action
- **[Relativism]**: allows for a wide range of ethical frameworks
# Challenges with various frameworks
- [Consequentialism]
	- Some don't consider consequences
	- Outcomes measured different by different people
	- Predicting outcomes
	- Whose 'good' matters?
- [Deontology]
	- Different beliefs = different decisions = conflict
	- Rules can be inflexible
	- Who makes the rules?
	- What is "right" and what is a "right"?
	- Rules & Rights can be adversarial
- [Virtue]:
	- Virtues differ from person to person, group to group
	- May not ensure good result
	- What creates "character"?
	- Is something Good in and of itself, or
		- Is the Good determined by another?
- [Relativism]
	- Very subjective, so how can you tell "good" or "bad"
	- Does it apply to itself?
	- Can lead to subjectivism
	- Lack of shared ethic can create conflict
	- Can undermine established values
-- All frameworks struggle to define/measure **justice** -- 

# [Subversive Ethics] / "Ethics for the Excluded"
- Emerge in response & reaction to Universal Ethics
- "Universal" Ethics -> aspire to be applicable in all places and times
	- Aristotle, Augustine, Aquinas, Kant, Bentham, Mill, others
- What do main proponents of universal ethics have in common?
	- All were men, white, relatively wealthy, in positions of prestige or power
- Universal ethics tends to ignore "**social location**" -> "The nature of trust and therefor the good, looks different depending upon where one is standing." - Ch. 6 in Intro Christian Ethics
- Subvert: undermine power/authority of established system/institution
- "Subversive" Ethics = alternative approaches to Universal Ethics
	- Deny many of the assumptions in universal approaches
	- Make reflection on social location to the starting point for ethics
- Social location: a person's sense of identity and understanding of reality is fundamentally shaped by their class, race, gender, and condition
- Social Locations associated with a "subversive" ethical approach
	- [**Class**]: includes the poor - Latin American "Liberation Theology"
		- Belief in God's "preferential option for the poor"
		- Commitment to address injustice through **praxis** then reflection
		- Emphasis on human rights, dignity, liberty, common good (p163)
			- Tends to conflict with "universal" rights such as right to property
			- Liberation theology rests in "realized eschatology" - Exodus story
	- **[Race]**: for minority racial and ethnic groups
		- Blacks in US: MLK, civil rights movement, black liberation theology, BLM
		- South Africa: Kairos Document, other races/places as well
	- **[Gender / Sexual Orientation]**: feminism (p182), LGBTQ community
	- **[Disability & Age]**: handicapped, elderly, children
