# What is Terrorism?
	- Class Suggestions:
		- Violence or threat to enact change
		- Fear tactics
- Overused & difficult to define
- Planned and systematic violent acts (or the threat thereof)
- Political in nature
- Aims for psychological impact
- Targeting deliberately includes non-combatants
##### "the deliberate **creation and exploitation of fear** through violence or the threat of violence in the pursuit of political change" (Hoffman, 44)

- Organizations & individuals 
- Yet states employ terror as well


## Examples of Terrorist Actions:
	- Class:
		- Bombing
		- Highjacking (plane, train)
		- Hostages
		- Extorition / Blackmail
		- Hacking
		- Mass shooting
- Chemical attacks
- Nuclear / biological 
-- Targets can be property or people - governmental, military, civilian, economic, symbolic -- 

- World Trade Center - Economic target
- Pentagon - Military target
- Failed - White House - Symbolic

-- Are criminal acts terrorism? Not necessarily 

## An evolving concept
- Nature of terrorism has changed significantly over time
- Roman Ear > Regin of Terror > Anarchist > State Terror > Modern
- \*Negative connotation has led to "semantical evasiveness" (Hoffman, 22)
- Defining by the nature of the act (Brian Jenkins)
	- Targeting of non-combatants = best indicator of terrorism or use of terror
- Walter Laqueur: "you know it when you see it"
- Definitions differ among US gov't agencies

## Why does terrorism begin?
- Often sparked by stagnant concentration of power in a society
- "Unfair" distribution of resources - actual or perceived
- Threat to long-standing social structures - actual or perceived
- Inability of a group ton defend itself or its interests
-- Perceptions matter greatly - conspiracy theories common --

# Domestic Terrorism Laws in US
- Us has no federal statue that criminalizes domestic terrorism
- . . . an expanded the definition of terrorism to cover "domestic"
 as opposed to just international terrorism
- Person engages in domestic terrorism if they do an act "dangerous to human life" that is a violation of the criminal laws of state or the US, if the act appears to be intended to:
	- Intimidate or coerce a civilian population
	- influence the policy of a government by intimidation or coercion 
	- to affect the conduct of a government by mass destruction, assassination or kidnapping
- Acts have to occur primarily within the territorial jurisdiction of United States

## Definitions of Terrorism:
#### Hoffman: Pg 32-34
#### Other:
- **State Department**: 'Pre-meditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against noncombatant targets by subnational groups or clandestine agents'
- **FBI**: 'The unlawful use of force or violence against persons or property to intimidate or coerce a Government, the civilian population, or any segment thereof, in furtherance of political or social objectives'
- **DHS**: "Any act of violence that is dangerous to human life or potentially destructive of critical infrastructure or key resources committed by a group or individual based and operating entirely within the United States or its territories without direction or inspiration from a foreign terrorist group..."
- **DOD**: "The unlawful use of violence or threat of violence, often motivated by religious, political, or other ideological beliefs to install fear and coerce governments or societies in pursuit of foals that are usually political."

### Tactical, Operational, Strategic Levels
- Tactical/Tactics: Occurs at lowest level (battels) in a limited areas for limited time, typically have limited impact beyond events
- Operational/Operations: users at level involving significant area, multiple units, longer period of time, have wider and potentially long-lasting impact
- Strategic/Strategy: tends to occur over broad area, involving multiple parties and operations, lasting for months/years, with impact that can be widespread in terms of both space and time - "campaigns"
