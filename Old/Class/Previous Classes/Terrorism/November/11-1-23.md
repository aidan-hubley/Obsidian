# Ethical Considerations for Policymakers on Responses to Terrorism
- Decapitation
- Negotiation
- Success
- Failure
- Repression
- Reorientation

## Success: Achieving Objectives
- Terrorist groups rarely achieve success
	- Takes time - survival is key
	- Avg length of time terrorist groups survive ~ 8 years
		- Longevity is the exception - connection to territory is key
- Success of terrorism does not legitimize the tactics
- Success depends on achievements and effects on population
	- Does it achieve benefits on the behalf of those it fights for?

- Terrorism's objectives can be categorized as:
	- **Tactical or short-term "process" goals**
		- Tend to perpetuate or extend the conflict
	- **Strategic or long-term "outcome" goals**
		- Aim to end terrorist campaign with victory

### Tactical "Process" Goals
- Can be aimed at the enemy (state) and its supporters
- OR can have other audiences
- Can be internal or external to the organization
- Process goals may not even directly engage the government

### Strategic "Outcome" Goals
- Can be political, economic, social, or religious
- Typically focus on the state or the population
	- Examples; independence, regime change, remove inequalities, please a god
- Cronin analyzed > 400 groups
	- 4.4% fully achieved strategic aims
	- 2.0% substantial achievement
	- 6.4% limited achievement
	- 87.1% achieved none
- "**Bounded Rationality**" concept*
	- Tactical objectives are easily achieved but Strategic outcomes are out of reach
-- Terrorism almost never installs new rulers, inspire ideological change, takes over territory, or constructs new institutions of governance - Cronin (82) --

## How Terrorism Ends - Strategic Success
- **Irgun**: Israel, 1931-48
	- Menachim Begin
- Initially targeted Arabs
- Shifted to **British** during WW II
	- 1944: armed revolt -- buildings
	- Hotel attack; hung 2 Brit soldiers
- British left after Mandate failed
	- International pressure

- **ANC** (South Africa)
	- Nelson Mandela
- Armed Struggle: 1961-1990
	- 1960: formed military wing
	- "armed propaganda"
- Escalated after 1976 Soweto riots
- Apartheid government lost legitimacy

### Conditions to Achieve Success
1. Goals of the group are well-defined & attainable
2. Goals align w/broader historical/political/economic changes
3. Terrorism is one part of broader campaign
	1. Cronin: "Terrorism is the **weak** tactic of the weak"
4. Groups convince other parities of legitimacy of their cause
-- it is impossible for terrorism alone to lead to success --

## Failure: Imploding, Backlash, Marginalization
- Most terrorist groups end in failure
- Governments tend to overemphasize role of CT in defeating terrorism
	- Desire by security forces to claim victory due to their own efforts
- Frequently what goes on **within** a terrorists group cases failure
	- Implosions

### Failure by Implosion: 4 Scenarios
- Failure to pass the cause on to the next generation
	- Long term nature of terrorism ends intergenerational process
- Infighting and Fractionalization - often difficult to detect
- Loss of Operational Control
	- Tradeoff between security and efficiency
	- Factions working at cross purposes or conducting undesirable attacks
- Accepting an Exit - amnesty, joining political process, flipping

### Failure by Marginalization - Diminishing Popular Support
- Terrorist groups cannot survive w/o **active** or **passive** support
- May decline because:
	- People fear the government
	- Government offers terrorist supporters a better choice
	- Population loses interest in terrorist group's ideology/objs
- Ideology becomes irrelevant
	- Fall of USSR and impact on Marxist-Lenist terrorist groups
- Loss of contact with "the People"
	- Mobilizing & sustaining support requires comms & contacts
	- Police and other CT efforts can hinder such interaction
- Targeting errors & backlash - common strategic error
	- Examples: RIRA, PFLP-GC, ETA, Italian Red Brigades, Islamic Gp

## How Failure Ends Terrorism
- TO's rely on claim to be acting on behalf of a larger cause
	- Deadly if TO's claim to be doing so is seen as false
- Operational errors = most common path to failure
	- Government can highlight repulsive actions & exploit errors
- Effective CT must understand unique dynamics
