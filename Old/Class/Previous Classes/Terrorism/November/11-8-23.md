	- Cronin: "most terrorist groups aspire to become insurgencies"
- Insurgencies
	- Offer an alternative system to existing government
		- Seize & hold territory - at least temporarily
		- Larger organizations operating as military units
		- Primarily target military forces using irregular tactics

### Shifts to Conventional War
- Terrorism can destabilize international system by:
	- Use of Weapon of Mess Destruction (WMD) or
	- Acting as catalyst for war **between states**
		- Terrorist attack can set off negative spiral of state actions when:
		1. Targeted government is vulnerable to provocation
		2. Terrorist attack perceived as sponsored by another state
		3. International system is in state of flux
		-- Hamas - Israel - Iran -- 
 - Potential: India, Pakistan, and Kashmiri separatist groups
	 - Three major conventional wars between India & Pakistan
	 - Pakistan supports Kashmiri separatist groups (terrorists)
		 - Kashmir region: deeply emotional issue for both sides 
		 - 2001: terror attack led to a million troops mobilized

# Counter Terrorism Case Study: France vs. FLN in Algeria
- 1945-1962: Algeria, a  French Department (~9 Million Muslims)
- Map of three French corps and boundaries of FLN political-military commands
- French had extensive expertise in counterinsurgency
- French chose Repression as primary approach - why?

## Front de Liberation Nationale (FLN)
- Causal Factors
	- France's defeat by Germany in 1940
	- France's refusal to grant independence after WW II
	- Influence of Arab nationalism - Egypt Gamel Abdel nasser
- Terrorism Goals (esp political)
	- Gain international support

## French Government & Military
- Causal Factors 
	- France's losses: Germany (1940), Indochina (1945), Suez (1956)
	- Large white settler community in Algeria since 1800s
- Counter-Terrorism / Counter-Insurgency Goals
	- Maintain Algeria as a Department integral to France

## Tactics & Operations
- 1954-6: FLN rural insurgency & non-lethal urban attacks
	- French military countered effectively - minimal publicity
- 1956-7: FLN shifts to urban terrorism & civilian targets
	- Opns timed to coincide with UN General Assembly
	- Extensive use of women to emplace bombs
	- Assassinations of government officials

## French Response
- 1956: French government executed 2 FLN leaders by guillotine
	- Created martyrs - FLN responded by attacking civilians
- Cycle of violence escalated between FLN & pied noirs
	- Both Muslim and European populations terrorized
	- Algiers police force (~1500) unable to contain violence

### Battle of Algiers
- 10th Para Division - elite force under General Massu
	- 4600 soldiers - given responsibility for order in city
	- **Quadrillage**: capital of Algiers divided into squares
		- Cordon - checkpoints - searches - mass arrests
		- Standard civil judicial procedures ignored
	- Used counter-terrorism to create **psychological shock**
- **Organigramme**: detailed analysis of terrorist network
	- Intelligence effort built in part through interrogation
- Torture - France's prior experiences (Horne, 196-7)
	- 1955 Wuillame Report proposed institutionalizing torture
- After war, French Gen Massu **claimed no other option existed**

### Victory or Loss?
- France's tactical success -> strategic failure
	- Focused world opinion on Algeria
	- Mobilized support for FLN
	- Heavily divided French public opinion
- French Government continued Repression in Algeria
	- Shift to Negotiations in final years of conflict
	- Eventual result: granted independence to Algeria in 1964xzasz
