# Conducting a Usability Test
- **Heuristic** - Create a list, team members compare to the list, meet as a team
- **Walk-Through** - Walk through the prototype with prospective users, explains the interface
- **Interaction** - Allows a group to interact with the prototype and provide feedback (Cannot be storyboards)
- **Formal Usability Testing** - Video users and records keystrokes, normally over an hours and takes 2-3 hours to review. Needs 5-10 users to get reliable results
