# Meals in the Ancient World
- Jewish meal began when the father or presiding member of the community
	- **took** bread
	- **broke** the bread
	- **blessed** it with the beraka = blessing thanksgiving
	- **given**

# Theological Views
- Lord's Supper (1 Cor 11:20)
	- Meal of fellowship shared with disciples
	- Church originally had a meal with Eucharist
- Eucharist
	- Means to "make thanks"
	- Prayer of thanksgiving said with bread and cup
	- Giving thanks for what Christ has done
- Communion - fellowship with Christ and one another
- Controversy over the presence of Christ in Communion
	- Whether and in what sense is Christ present when communion is celebrated?

## Views of Christ's Presence in Communion
---Is he really present?
- No -> **Zwingli**
- Yes
	- Spiritually in Elements
		- In community -> **Anabaptist**
		- In elements -> **Calvin**
	- Physically in Elements -> **Catholic / Lutheran**
		--- Catholics call it "**transubstantiated**"
		--- Lutherans call it "**consubstantiated**"

- If we reject real presence of Christ in communion, are we arguing for the real absence of Christ?

# Biblical / Theological / Historical Aspects and Meaning
- Past
	- Passover (Christ is providing another Passover)
	- Christ's life (table fellowship and feeding of multitude)
	- Christ's death
- Present
	- Jesus says he stands at the door and knocks, whoever would open the Door.... Sup with him and he with me. Like the disciples on the road to Emmaus, sometimes we encounter Christ in fresh and new ways in the breaking of bread together.
- Future
	- Jesus connected the meal to the coming Kingdom (Luke 22:16)
	- A celebration not a wake!
	- Has an ethnical dimension

- "Unity" - one loaf, one cup
- Evangelism - proclaim the Lord's death
- Remembering and being Re-remembered

- Re-enacting or Participation 
	- When we partake of communion we are not only remembering the fact that his body was broken and his blood was poured out, BUT It is not just a memorial of something that he did, it is a re-enactment that we killed him. We are accomplices to a murder.  
	- My teeth must tear and grind his body – symbolizing that my sin killed him!  
	- My throat must swallow the blood that my sin and guilt demanded!

# Eschatology
- The goal of our salvation. 
- Our eschatological hope. 
- The completion of our salvation. 
- We’ll be perfectly conformed to Christ.  
- Includes resurrection. 
- We’ll be spared from God’s wrath. 
- Includes the renewal of creation. 
- Heaven is not our final hope. 
- Orthodox theosis

## Whose?
- The study of the last things, the completion of God’s plan for creation.  
	- Personal eschatology = the goal of each of us as individuals.  
	- Corporate eschatology = the goal of history and humankind in general.  
	- Cosmic eschatology = the goal of creation.
