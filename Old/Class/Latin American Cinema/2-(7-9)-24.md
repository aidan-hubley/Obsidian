# The Use of Architecture in Cautiva
- Camera on protagonist but something is obstructing our view, very symbolic to the theme of the movie
	- Her real mother's dream home, covered in glass, symbolic to the truth 
	- The house is very modern
- Many sequences in corridors, normally cut in Hollywood, but intentionally present in this film to provoke . . .

Sequence 1: Christina finally reconnects with her real family
- Her mother's bedroom is preserved perfectly since her was killed
- Camera pans around the room, displaying her mother's life 
	- Lots of folk art, drawing desk, 
	- 'Ode to the Present' by Neruda prominent Chilean poet is present in the room
		- He was likely killed because of his opposition to the dictatorship
	- Her mother must have been very cultured and a great architect, likely informed politically 
	- Reference: "Soul Sacrifice" Record by Sanata
- Strong use of mirror in a beautiful shot when she looks into the mirror at herself

Sequence 2: Christian is called out of class, and walked through the catholic school to meet federal agents in Mother Superior's office 
- Lots of walking through corridors and closing doors behind them, very intimidating and powerful
- Capital / Courthouse is very labyrinth like

Main questions for assignment: 

- What objects, artifacts, and cultural products do we see as the camera pans through the room?
	- "Girl with the pearl earrings" painting by Johannes Vermeer 
	- "Relativity' - M. C. Escher

- How does the director use the close-up in this sequence, and how does the mirror work to express the protagonist’s ‘double identity’?
	- She looks into the mirror in her mother's mirror, seeing a version of herself in her mother's life and knows her true identity, and the version of her in the real world that she is familiar with
	- Her 2 identities are meeting each other / a shift in her identity or a shift in perspective 
	- Turning Point:
		- She starts arguing with fake family after this
		- She gets closer to her real family after this

- Are there any moments in the film that work similarly?


- Powerful shots suggesting the theme of obstructed view, partially hidden truth. 
- Her life was perfectly fine than a 'bomb' like this dropped
