# Motorcycle Diaries 
### Aesthetics 
- Single subject shots of motorcycle
- Change in seasons
- Often times the camera is distance from the characters
	- Characters become integrated into the landscape

- Poetic evocative voiceover (letters from main character to mother)

### Movie is broken into chapters (stops along journey)
- Date: 1952

--- documentary: Nostalgia for Delight
- In reference to the desert the duo travel trough, where they see lots of political dissonance 

- The desert is vital to Che's perspective, its where he is first introduced to the insane amount of injustice in Latin America
	- Che exchanges matte with the couple who are traveling to avoid political prosecution whereas our main duo are traveling just to travel, this heavily impact's Che's perspective

- Machu Picchu, Peru
	- Where they begin documenting their trip with photography, the real pictures taken by the duo are shown during the credits of the movie
	- "How is it possible to geel nostalgia for a world I never know: How can a civilization that built this... be destroyed to build..."

- San Pablo, Peru
	- The Leper Colony
	- Che cannot stand the separation of the Lepers and the healthy, he swims across the river despite his asthma

## A Pan-American aesthetic?
- Documentary aesthetics & photographic realism
- Improvisation (professional and non-professional actors)
- Location shooting
- Natural lighting
- Long, uncut sequences
	- Overall a slower type of cinema, more grounded
- Long shots, emphasis on the landscape
- Use of black and white photography

## Black + White Faces end scene?
- Influenced by Sebastiao Salgado
	- Honored member of the Academy of Arts and Science
	- He depicts intense front facing portraits of marginalized people
	- Lots of kids and orphans, exploited works + pollutions
- Influenced by Martin Chambi
	- "It is wrong to focus too much on the testimonial value of his photo. They have that indeed, but, in equal measure they express the milieu in which he lived and they show ... that when he got behind a camera, he became a giant, a true inventor, a veritable force of invention, a recreator of life." - Chambi
- Technically, not photos but rather live photos (Living Tablo)
- The characters in the photos break the 4th walls by looking directly at the audience 
- Almost a living slideshow
- I love how the voiceover stops before the slideshow starts, where it paints the injustice as something bigger than just our protagonists 
- Shows the interconnectedness of Latin American, they all suffer from injustice
- Hard cut from the slideshow to the an explanation of Che's revolutionary actions
- Final shot of the real life Alberto standing in the same location as the actor, still watching the plane fly away from him, very symbolic for there dynamic 
- Final slideshow of the real life photos the duo took in 1950s across their journey 
- Music: Incredible and very memorable, its sad and engaging
