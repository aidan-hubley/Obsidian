	- Is it “my” body?  
	- My body – my choice.
- If our bodies are gifts, then their value is not dependent on their worth to us.
- It receives its ultimate worth from its union with Christ (made possible by the Son taking on a body).  
- What might an attractive vision of what is right and good and true, a theological vision of the beauty of physical human life and of the world as God’s creation, an appealing vision of the beauty

- I want to give myself completely to you and to receive you as a gift.

- So shame is bad, but a shameless person is not fully human (Have you no shame?!)  
- People without any shame are sociopaths and dangerous to society.
