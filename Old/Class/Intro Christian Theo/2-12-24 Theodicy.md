"The Biggest Challenge to Christianity"

# Why is there evil?
- God is good
- God is all-powerful 
- God is creator
- Evil exists
- Theodicy = defense of God's justice, given the evil in creation

# The Problem?
1. A perfectly powerful being can prevent any evil.  
2. A perfectly good being will prevent evil as far as he can.  
3. God is perfectly powerful and good.  
4. So, if a perfectly powerful and good God exists, there will be no evil.  
5. There is evil.  
6. Therefore, God doesn’t exist.

# Evil
- Classically defined as the “absence of the good" (privation boni), evil then is a depravation, corruption, or perversion of the good.
- Just as darkness is the absence of light and silence – sound, evil is the absence of the good.
- Biblically and theologically, evil has been understood as
	- Chaos 
	- Sin
	- Satanic
	- Suffering

## Types of Evil
- Moral evil signifies suffering caused by human agency.
- Natural evil signifies suffering caused by natural causes
- Metaphysical evil signifies the underlying cosmic structures that cause evil

# Theodicy
- One of the most perplexing issues for Christian faith.  
- Perhaps the greatest challenge to the truthfulness and reality of Christianity.  
- But we are not alone in the challenges of evil and suffering.
- Problem is critical for Calvinism.
	- If God causes everything, is God responsible for evil?
	- How can God’s sovereignty be reconciled with human responsibility?  
	- A mystery or a self-contradiction?

## Theodicy: Calvinism 
- God decrees evil to achieve a greater good.
	- Sometimes to the person experiencing it.  
	- Evil brings glory to God by letting him demonstrate his justice.  
	- It demonstrates God’s mercy toward the elect.  
	- Does the intention make an act good or evil?

## Theodicy: Arminianism: 
- God grants freedom and responsibility to make moral choices.  
	- Without freedom, they can’t be responsible.  
	- God’s will can be thwarted by human decisions, within limits. 
	- God wants all people to be saved, but he lets people reject his offer. 
	- God does not decree evil, but he brings good out of evil

## Defenses: Free Will
- Most common response: free will defense
	- Free will requires the possibility of evil
	- Evil exists through the free choice of creatures

### Free-will Defense
- FWD transfers moral culpability for evil from God to humanity by attributing its origin to the misues of free will. Freedom is the morally sufficient reason why God permits evil.  
- God gave the freedom to love – without the freedom to say, “no,” there is no meaning to saying, “yes.”

## Defenses: Soul-making
- Proposed by John Hick
- At its core, it argues that suffering, struggle, and pain are necessary for spiritual, moral, and intellectual growth

## Defense: Process Theodicy
- Emerges from Process Theology argues that God is not omnipotent and therefore cannot prevent evil.  
- God and humanity must work together to overcome evil and injustice and to realize greater states of freedom, love, and creativity.

## Defenses: Cruciform Theodicy
- God takes on human suffering himself
- In fact, the cross is God's definitive response to evil
- Essentially rejects the notion of divine impassibility 
- "For a God who is incapable of suffering is a being who cannot be involved. Suffering and injustice do not affect him. And because he is so completely insensitive, he cannot be affected or shaken by anything. He cannot weep, for he has no tears. But the one who cannot suffer cannot love either. So he is also a loveless being.” - Jurgen Moltmann, The Crucified God

# The Problem of Evil
- Important to remember:
	- God has acted in Christ to defeat evil.
	- God identifies with us in our experience of evil.
	- God will meet us and will see us through. 
	- God’s answer is Jesus.

# Views
- Greater Good - Determinism
	- God wills evil because He brings about greater good
	- God's goodness takes a hit for allowing evil
- Free Will - Simple Foreknowledge
	- Prescriptive will of God vs. Permissive will of God
	- He wants something for us, but allows other things to happen
	- God didn't make evil, but He created a world where evil exists, His power takes a hit for not being able to create a world without evil
- Cruciform - Open Theism
	- God doesn't know when evil happens because of free will
	- God's omniscience takes a hit 
- Molonism - Middle Knowledge
- Process . . .
