# Class Discussion
- Continuationist - Ecstatic gifts (tongues, miracles, gift of healing)
	- Lack of evidence to support the death of gifts
	- When is the perfection to cease the gift of tongues? 
	- Perfection coming = Jesus returning
- Cessationist - Ecstatic gifts died with Apostol  
	- Miraculous gifts served to authenticate the early Church and establish the New Testament writings. Once the canon was complete, these gifts were no longer necessary.
	- Speaking in tongues is meant for the people in Israel, when salvation is meant for everyone, tongues aren't
	- Scripture says there is a time when tongues will cease
	- Perfection coming = The Bible exists
	- History: Tongues have ceased since the early church days until recent ways, when used in the early church, a translator was used

# Connectedness of Theology
- You cannot really discuss Pneumatology without talking about Trinity, Salvation, Church, Eschatology, etc.  
- To make a claim about any one doctrine is to affect all the others.

# Historical Context
- While the Holy Spirit is critical to our understanding of all of the doctrines of the faith, the Church has historically said very little dogmatically about the Holy Spirit in comparison to other major doctrines of the Christian faith.
- The Holy Spirit is a distinct person within the Trinity.
- The Holy Spirit is coequal, coeternal, and sharing substance with the Father and the Son.  
- The Holy Spirit proceeds from the Father in some way (and from the Son if you prefer).  
--- 'From the Father, through the Son' ---
- But little else is declared as dogma.
- Pneumatology has historically been a difficult subject for the Church.  
- Gregory Nazianzus The subject of the Holy Spirit presents a special difficulty, because by the time we get to it we are “worn out by the multitude of questions.” - Fifth Oration, On the Holy Spirit

## Terms

### Perichoresis, Circumincession  
- It is the image of the dance. Translated by the Latin “circumincession.”  
- It allows the individuality of the persons to be maintained, while insisting that each person shares in the life of the other two. An image often used to express this idea is that of a 'community of being,' in which each person, while maintaining its distinctive identity, penetrates the others and is penetrated by them.”  
- Alister McGrath, Christian Theology: An Introduction, 3rd ed. Blackwell, 2001, 325.

	2. Jesus is called parakletos in 1 John 2:1.
- The Spirit has intellect.  
	1. Can be lied to (Acts 5:3-4).  
	2. Engages in deliberations with church -- “it seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us” (Acts 15:28).
	3. Expresses our longings to God (Rom. 8:26-27) and communicates God’s thoughts to us (1 Cor. 2:10-14).
- The Spirit has emotions.  
	1. Communicates God’s love to us (Rom. 5:5).

## Divinity of the Holy Spirit
- Gregory Nazianzen (Orat. XLI.9)  
	- Always existed, and exists, and always will exist, who neither had a beginning, nor will have an end... perfecting, not being perfected; sanctifying, not being sanctified; deifying, not being deified...Life and Life-giver; Light and Light-giver; absolute Good, and Spring of Goodness...by whom the Father is known and the Son is glorified....”
- Spoken of in parallel with God (1 Cor. 3:16-17, temple); Acts 5:3-4 (Ananias and Sapphira).  
- Mentioned with Father and Son in Trinitarian formulas (Mt. 28:18- 20; 2 Cor. 13:14 [blessing]; 1 Cor. 12:4-6 [source of gifts]; 1 Pet. 1:2 [involvement with Father and Son in salvation process]).  
- Called eternal (Heb. 9:14; cf. 1:10-12, of God).
- Said to know everything, even the depths of God (1 Cor. 2:10-11).  
- Agent in creation and regeneration and resurrection (Gen. 1:2; John 3:5-8; Rom. 1:4).  
- The Spirit can be sinned against.  
	1. The Spirit can be resisted (Acts 7:51).  
	2. The Spirit can be quenched (1 Thess. 5:19).  
	3. The Spirit’s aid in the Christian life can be refused (Gal. 3:2-3).
	4. The Spirit can be grieved by sin (Eph. 4:30).  
	5. The Spirit can be blasphemed (Mt. 12:31-32; Mk. 3:27-28;  Luke 10:12).

## The Holy Spirit and the Trinity
- The Spirit is said to “go out” or “proceed” from the Father (John 15:26).  
	1. The Spirit is sent by Jesus (John 15:26) or by the Father (John 14:16, 26).  
	2. After the resurrection, Jesus breathed on the 	disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22).  
	3. Peter at Pentecost said the exalted Christ had  
	received from the Father the promised Holy Spirit and had 	poured out the Spirit on the disciples (Acts 2:33).
--- Filioque - and from the Son
- The Spirit is closely identified with the Father and especially with the exalted Christ.  
	1. Paul parallels “the Spirit,” “the Spirit of God,” “the Spirit of Christ” and “Christ” (Rom. 8:9-11).  
	2. For Paul, being “in Christ” and “in the Spirit” refer to the same reality (Rom. 8:1; Phil. 2:1).  
	3. Sometimes Christ and the Spirit are directly identified: “The Lord is the Spirit” (2 Cor. 3:17-18).
