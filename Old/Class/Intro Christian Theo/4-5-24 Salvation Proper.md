# Righteousness: Imputed, Imparted, or Infused?
- The application of the righteousness of Christ has been understood in three ways
1. Imputed: God declares us righteous in Christ
2. Imparted: God gives us a righteous principle that leads to sanctification
3. Infused: God gives the righteousness of Christ in small amounts over time, primarily through the sacraments (dissipates by worldly living, enhanced by good works)

# Salvation and Creation
- “God is still at work in this creation and not just its maintenance engineer,” Eugene Peterson (Peterson 2005:93)
- God so loved the world (maybe this is not just shorthand for “all people”)
- The gospel of Jesus Christ is based on what the Bible teaches about creation, redemption and transformation through Jesus Christ.  
- It envisions a transformed New Creation at the end of time. The new creation we now experience through Jesus Christ (2 Cor. 5:17) is the firstfruits not only of our own salvation, but of all creation healed.
- Scripture presents salvation as an immense divine plan for the redemption of all creation, “the restoration of all things” (Acts 3:21).  
- We read in Ephesians 1:10 that God has a plan (oikonomia) for the fullness of time to bring everything in heaven and earth together in reconciliation under the headship of Jesus Christ—all things, things in heaven and things on earth; things visible and invisible.
