# Graduate School
- Some of you will opt to jump into graduate school directly after you graduate. This will help you in some ways, as well as bring in unique challenges
- A benefit is that you do not have to begin repaying your undergraduate loans while you are actively enrolled in a graduate program
- A lot of graduate programs to help you pay off your loans, or avoid taking full loans for your new program
- Look for part time jobs on campus to help pay off your schooling as your go. This could have other benefits towards payment!

#### Note: There is not shame in a gap year
