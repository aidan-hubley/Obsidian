My commitment to cultural intelligence and inclusive excellence is rooted in a genuine belief in the inherent value of diversity and the importance of fostering an environment where all individuals feel valued, respected, and included. Throughout my experiences, I have consistently sought to engage with people of diverse identities, recognizing the richness that different perspectives, backgrounds, and experiences bring to our communities. I firmly believe that cultural intelligence, defined as the capability to relate and work effectively across cultures, is essential for promoting understanding, empathy, and collaboration across diverse groups. In my role as an RA and ARD,  I am dedicated to promoting unity on our campus through intentional efforts to cultivate an environment of inclusivity and acceptance. I understand that unity is not about erasing differences but rather embracing and celebrating them. I am committed to fostering meaningful conversations that encourage dialogue, understanding, and the discovery of common ground among individuals from various backgrounds. I recognize the importance of actively promoting inclusive excellence, which involves ongoing engagement with diversity in interpersonal relationships and within our campus community. Whether I find myself in a leadership position or not, I will lead by example, demonstrating acceptance and respect for all individuals regardless of their race, gender, ability, sexual orientation, religious expression, or any other aspect of their identity. I am dedicated to creating a supportive and inclusive environment where all students, staff, and faculty feel empowered to contribute their unique perspectives and talents. By prioritizing cultural intelligence and inclusive excellence, I am committed to advancing Messiah University's commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and contributing to the creation of a campus community where everyone can thrive.
