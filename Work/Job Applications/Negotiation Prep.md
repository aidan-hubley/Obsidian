- I am a known entity
	- 3 years in res life speak to my character and reliability 
	- 2 years + 1 summer in the SOC speak to my ability and technical competency

- Coming into the position I have two major expenses 
	- Student Debt - which they can't help me with
	- Housing - Oakwood 

- I could commute to campus 4 days a week for $70,000
	- Or if you could provide housing on campus (in the loft) or in Oakwood, I could work 5 days a week for $63,000
