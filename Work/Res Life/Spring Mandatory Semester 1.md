## Values Exercise
- Pass out sticky notes to everyone
	- Individually write two values you desire to see on the floor
	- Share with the floor
- Split into groups and discuss what you value on the floor. 
	- Ex: trust, communication, alone time, etc.
- What was missing from the floor last year?
- What do you want to see more of this year?
- As a group, rank your **top ten values**
- One member of the group will fill out the google form with your ranking of values!
