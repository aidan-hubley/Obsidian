10. At 7:00pm on Friday December 8th, 2023, RAs Aidan Hubley and Silas Barnes arrived at Kelly A 001 to assist with resident Kayleigh Leonard's move out process. Present at Kelly A 001 was Kayleigh's mother, Melinda Dickman, and Kayleigh's boyfriend, Matthew Rabinowitz (Kayleigh's roommates were not permitted to be present during this checkout time). As Aidan and Silas assisted with Kayleigh's moveout, Matthew made many concerning comments regarding his anger towards Kayleigh's roommates: Eliana Hamon, Abigail Edell, and Julie Nelson. Matthew stated "fuck these bitches", and "they're just a bunch of cunts". Matthew described his willingness and history of violence to Aidan and Silas, by providing an example: when two of his roommates from college "molested" him, he "knocked them out." He suggested he wouldn't be afraid to use violence against Kayleigh's roommates. Matthew recommended leaving hateful notes, leaving messes, damaging property, and stealing from the roommates. Matthew mentioned to Silas and Aidan that he is involved in a "gang", Matthew asked Kayleigh if he should "green light" her roommates, Kayleigh replied "it would be expensive", Matthew replied "yeah, bullets cost money." Aside from mentioning his gang, Matthew also expressed "I'm an equal rights equal fights guy, so if they want to continue messing like this, I have no problem showing up at their doorstep" in reference to attacking roommates: Eliana, Abigail, and Julie; many similar comments were made throughout the hours spent moving out resident Kayleigh. In addition to the safety of the roommates, Matthew also mentioned to Silas and Aidan (in an attempt to report roommates) that Eliana, Abigail, and Julie "took" Kayleigh to Eliana's cabin and "got her plastered by forcing shots down her throat." Matthew and Kayleigh alerted Silas and Aidan that Eliana and Abigail had been storing alcohol under their beds, Silas and Aidan informed them about potential amnesty only if alcohol were present and that the proper authorities would investigate further Matthew insisted on leaving a hateful note stating: "FUCK YOU from Matthew P.S. KYS" (Kill Yourselves) (Refer to Safety's report for this evidence). Matthew found a bottle opener in the apartment, Kayleigh told him that the bottle opener was not hers, Matthew said: "Fuck it, its mine now" and stole it. From time to time throughout the interaction, Matthew waved around a vape, and later would use it despite Aidan requesting him not to. At 8:30pm resident Kayleigh Leonard, Matthew Rabinowitz, and Melinda Dickman departed campus. 

Silas and Aidan called the RD on call, Curtis Kurtz, who informed other authorities (Campus Safety, Lyndsay Grimm, Doug Wood). Curtis, Silas, Aidan, and two Safety Officers met to discuss what happened in the Kelly classroom. Residents Kaytlyn Weaver and Allyson Lyndaker overheard some of Matthew's comments and would join the Campus Safety meeting with concerns. Collectively Aidan, Silas, Kaytlyn, and Allyson filled statements with Campus Safety. 

Aidan, Silas, Curtis, and Campus Safety Officers sat down with residents: Eliana (via phone), Abigail, and Julie, in Kelly A 001. Curtis and the Safety Officers discussed the situation and options for the residents' safety and future housing. (See RD Curtis's report) Over the course of the discussion, Eliana volunteered to house the roommates for the night, and she and fiancé Joshua Pedersen arrived on campus. Friend of residence Julie Nelson, William Reeder was request as emotional support for Julie. After discussion amongst the roommates, Campus Safety was tasked with informing the police. Officer Christopher M. Desiderio arrived to take statements and contact info. (See Officer Desiderio's report)
