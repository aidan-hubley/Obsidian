# Returning in January to the Same Room
DO THESE THINGS BEFORE YOU LEAVE! 

When you leave your residence for semester break, you must complete the tag posted on your door. Complete and sign the door tag when you leave. Please coordinate what needs to be done with your roommate(s) so you all share the work. Everyone in the space needs to sign the door tag. Failure to complete everything on the door tag will result in an improper check-out charge of $50. 

-   Close and lock windows. Don’t forget to check the top window (if applicable)! 
-   Close blinds/shades. 
-   Remove all perishable foods.  
-   Empty and clean compost container (if applicable). 
-   Unplug everything, including your mini-refrigerator in your room - do not use the bathroom to defrost. If you leave your devices plugged in, the university will not be responsible for any damage due to a power surge. It could take up to 24 hours to defrost your mini-refrigerator so please plan ahead. 
-   Remove all room trash and dispose of it properly. Trash left in rooms attracts bugs. 
-   Submit work orders for anything in your room/apartment/house not working properly. 
-   *RES HALL residents please remove all personal items from the bathrooms & lounge kitchens. 
-   Turn lights off. 
-   Lock your door. 
-   Double check to make sure your door is locked. 
    

## These items will not result in a charge, but are helpful reminders: 

-   Take valuable items home (passport, medication, professional clothes if interviewing). Although reasonable precautions will be taken to safeguard your belongings, the university is not responsible for loss or theft.   
-   Remove items from floor and under the bed in case of a pipe break or water leak – especially wise for rooms on the ground floors. 
-   Take your pet fish or plants with you.

# Rooms with Open Spaces
If you have an empty space in your residence, there is a chance you will receive a new roommate for the spring semester.  If you are receiving a new roommate, you will be notified via email to your Messiah email account.  It does not happen often, but it is possible that a student will decide to attend Messiah University over Christmas Break and we will be unable to contact you prior to your departure for break. For that reason, you will need to prepare your room before leaving for break to accommodate and welcome a new roommate. To prepare your room please empty and clean off/out one bed, closet, desk, dresser and wall space.   

Failure to make preparations for a new roommate may result in the remaining roommate(s) being charged a steep fine because University personnel will need to make space in your room. The bigger concern with a room not being prepared is that it does not make a new student feel welcome to Messiah University.


# UPDATES FOR ALL RESIDENTS
-   >>Mandatory meeting next semester: Monday, 9:30pm January 9, 2023. 
-   Snowball Info: no snow is to be thrown at windows or brought inside of buildings. Throwing snowballs at vehicles can be a danger to drivers and/or cause injury. Even if you know the person(s) who are in a room/vehicle and they’re ok with it, others in adjacent rooms/vehicles may be annoyed or alarmed by the act. And, even if you meant no harm to anyone, it could result in a student conduct incident. 
-   Floor announcements? 
-   Questions?  
	-   If anyone asks about returning early, have them email Courtney Williams at [housing@messiah.edu](mailto:housing@messiah.edu).

## **>>>>Floor Feedback Survey<<<<**

-   We are all now going to take the time to fill out the RA/Community survey. 
-   Please be honest about your experience here on the floor. These surveys are utilized to gauge students’ experiences and provide helpful context to the RAs of ways the community could be improved and/or things going well for residents. 
-   The survey can be found on Canvas or via QR code.  
-   This is to be completed individually; please do not converse while filling this out.

# Dismiss everyone EXCEPT those who are moving out or are making a room change

### NOT RETURNING FOR THE SPRING SEMESTER or NOT RETURNING TO THE SAME RESIDENCES

-   When you leave for semester break, complete the tag posted on your door. PLEASE COMPLETE AND SIGN THE DOOR TAG when you leave. Each person leaving will have their own door tag. Failure to complete everything on the door tag will result in an improper check-out charge of $50.

	-   Be on time for your appointment! Your room is expected to be completely prepared for check out at the time scheduled with your RA. Failure to be ready at your requested check-out time and/or to complete all the required check-out paperwork/process will result in an improper check-out charge.  
-   Your RA will complete the RCI form with you  
	-   The form must be completed/signed and room key returned (to the res life office in Eisenhower) to avoid an improper check out charge. The RA will give your form to the RD who will do a final assessment of your room.

## Directions for New Resident Check-In

## KEY THINGS TO REMEMBER
(if you are changing rooms or leaving permanently)

-   You must check-out with an RA to avoid an improper checkout charge of $50. 
-   Keys must be turned in to the ResLife office (Eisenhower 166) to avoid a $75 key replacement charge. If you are checking out after 5pm please drop your key off at the ResLife office via the key slot next to the office door (please put your key in a labeled envelope). 
-   Rooms will be inspected by an RD who will make all final determinations about damages/other billing charges.   
-   Damage/billing charges are the decision of your RD, not your RA.  
-   Failure to complete the items on the door checklist and/or items not in compliance with the Code of Conduct will be confiscated and handled through the university disciplinary process.
