#ResLife
# Common Gathering 1/10/2022:
The idea is to split the residents into groups of 3 or 4 guys, give them all a sticky note and a pen, and ask them to evaluate their values and the values they wish their floor displayed. They will write two of these values onto the sticky note and discuss their values with the rest of their group.

- The hope is that these groups are small enough that it could lead to dorm room interaction + the group members will be hand picked which will lead to direct conversation between those who wouldn't normally interact.

### Process:
1. Pass out sticky notes + writing utensils (if needed)
2. Explain the group members 

- Potentially:
	- "We want you (the groups) to disperse throughout the floor so you can have the time and space to meet each other and discuss your values." 
	- "We want no more than a single group to use the lounge"
			- Hopefully getting these groups to collectively decide to use one of the member's rooms as a meeting spot.
