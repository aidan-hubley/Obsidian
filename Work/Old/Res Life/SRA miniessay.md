#ResLife
After taking a look at the job description of the SRA position the only element that would be challenging for me is: "If on-campus paid work beyond the SRA role is desired, it can be no more than five hours per week and must be approved by your RD prior to starting." This is obviously reasonable, I would assume it is meant to ensure that the SRA is dedicated to their role and not overworked in another job. I am very dedicated to another position on campus. I work for the catering company on campus and have been tasked to deliver meals to those in quarantine. These students are unable to return home and must remain isolated until they recover and are no longer contagious. This position means a lot to me, I love providing for them, and I would have a difficult time not being able to work this position. A few things to note, I work one hour a day, meaning it would lead to a 7-hour workweek. I believe I could handle this position in conjunction with the SRA position, however, I understand that I could be expected to drop or shorten my catering hours. Also, this role is heavily dependent on the number of students who must stay in quarantine, and it is dependent on quarantine being offered by Messiah. These two are both up in the air and likely to change. I would lessen my hours for the catering company if necessary.
