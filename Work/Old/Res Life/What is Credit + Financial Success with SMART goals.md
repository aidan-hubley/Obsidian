# What is Credit?
- The ability to borrow money with the promise that you'll repay it in the future, often with interest
- What is a Credit/FICO Score?
	- A FICO score is a three digit number, ranging from 300-850
	- Higher number = better
- The number tells lenders how likely you are to repay loan
- Good credit score: 670-739
- Having good credit makes it easier to do many things in life which include:
	- Rent an apartment
	- Buy a home
	- Sign up for a cell plan
	- Apply for grad loan or private loan
	- Applying for a JOB
##### Credit Tip: With good credit, you can even save money in the form of lower interest rates or waived fees and down payments when setting up utilities
## What can Affect your FICO Score?
- FICO does not reveal its scoring formula to an individual, but they give useful guidelines
	- Payment history - late payments can really hurt your score, as can accounts in collections, or a bankruptcy
	- Amount of debt relative to credit limits - this is how much of your available credit you are using - the less, the better for you score!
	- Age of credit - this refers to how long you've had credit and the average age of your credit accounts
	- Recent applications for credits - A so-called "Hard inquiry" when you apply for new credit can nick your score for up to six months
	- If you have one type of credit - installment loans (home/car) or revolving credit (credit cards)

## How can I build or strengthen my credit?
- Be sure to make payments on time
- Make at least the minimum payment to avoid being hit with a penalty for a missed payment
- Keep your credit utilization low ... say no to credit cards
- Keep credit accounts open...
