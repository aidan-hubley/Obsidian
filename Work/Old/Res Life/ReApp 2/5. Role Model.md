#ResLife
I find that I model time management, responsibility while on the job, and outward care for those around me well. I am vocal about my academic and extra-curricular schedules with my team. I update them with the solutions that I find to my problems, and I reach out to them for support. I believe this models good time management. I have found myself supporting other members of my team in the past when it comes to RA responsibilities. I have motivated them to stick to the expectations of the job, and on occasion, stepped into their situation to assist with an appropriate resolution. Finally, I believe I display care for those around me in a visible way. I have covered on-call and on-clock shifts when someone is in need. I reach out to those who I notice are not doing well, and often meet up with my team members to check in. 

If a fellow RA was wrestling with University policies I would advise them to recognize that a discrepancy between their own beliefs and Messiah's policies is acceptable and appropriate. I would assure them that you are not expected to change their beliefs to work as an RA, and I would advise them to bring their struggles to their RD. I would likely share an experience where my beliefs differed from Messiah's policies, and assure them that you can find common ground while still enforcing Messiah's policies.
