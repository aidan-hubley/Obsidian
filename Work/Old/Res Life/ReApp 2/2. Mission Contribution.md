#ResLife
While contributing to the mission of Residence Life I have provided a safe living environment for my residents. I responded to a medical emergency by calling a 911 operator, contacting the RD on call, and the medics on campus. After the medical emergency was handled appropriately, I checked up and emotionally supported my residents who had heard or witnessed the emergency. I focused on ensuring that the safety of my living environment was not compromised and that my residents felt my supportive presence after the situation was resolved.

I found myself in a returning RA role this previous semester, and because of this, I felt that I had the ability and responsibility to work toward a hospitality-focused team atmosphere. I have hospitably reached out to members of my team, checking in on how they are handling responsibilities both when they pertain to residence life and when they do not. I hold optional events for the team to strengthen team dynamics and ensure communication between team members continues. 

I have holistically supported members of my team during a confidentially important situation. Opting to involve myself in the situation to support them mentally and emotionally rather than assuming they could handle it alone. I set up meetings with our RD and individually with them to promote continued dialogue to ensure they knew I was there to offer holistic support.
